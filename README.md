LLM language design is a method for structuring the outputs of large language models. You can think of the language grammars as sophisticated templates which if instructed LLMs will fill the "holes" of when generating text. They are a means of declaratively guiding the behavior of LLMs on a number of axes.

ConceptScript has been an attempt to find a meeting point between the internal structures of LLMs and human thinking. The primary use cases I've found so far are: drawing out rich detailed information from minimal input, distilling complex textual sources to logical essences, evolving conceptual models through LLM dialog as a means of theoretical exploration, and automated synthesis of heterogeneous complex ideas.

I believe much of the value here is in language design as a general technique for interacting with LLMs: a kind of precision tool for "LLM whisperers". I don't think ConceptScript or any other LLM language will attain a perfected final form; what makes a language optimal is relative to the model it runs on and the problem you're trying to solve. That said, there are enough commonalities between models at this point that many general principles will likely be stable over time and across models: I'm sure many remain to be discovered, too.

The purpose of this repository is to share my findings so far on this topic, and to provide some structure for continued collaborative exploration.

To get started I would recommend watching the video below.
