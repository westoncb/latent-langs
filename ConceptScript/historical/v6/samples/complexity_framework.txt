The Complexity-Entropy-Action Principle expresses the fundamental relationship between complexity, entropy, negentropy, and the capacity for action.
The Complexity Flow Equations describe the dynamics of complexity in terms of velocity, source, diffusivity, and the overall flow equation.
Dynamical Complexity and Evolution capture the conditions for the evolution of a system in terms of increasing complexity and efficiency, and the relationship between complexity, information content, and evolution.
Transfer Entropy and Synergy express the relationship between transfer entropy, synergistic information flow, and the joint complexity of interacting systems.
Mutual Information and Information Content capture the relationship between mutual information, information content, and the individual and joint entropies of systems.
The Arrow of Time and Irreversibility are represented by the increase of complexity with time, the loss of information about the past, the increase of action required for the future, and the irreversibility of processes.
Predictability and Controllability are expressed in terms of their relationship to information about the future, action required for the future, and their decrease over time.
Emergence and Hierarchy are captured by the increase of complexity across scales, the presence of mutual information between levels, and the greater action required for emergence compared to reduction.
Adaptation and Co-evolution are represented by the mutual information between system and environment, the increase of this mutual information during adaptation, the increase of system complexity during evolution, and the greater action required for evolution compared to stasis.
