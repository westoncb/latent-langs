This Concept, called SyntheticCreativity, outlines a framework for generating novel, aesthetically pleasing, and practical creative artifacts using a combination of generative modeling, discriminative evaluation, and metrics for novelty and aesthetics.

The key components are:

A generative model G that maps from a space of base concepts Ω to a space of possible artifacts Ψ
A discriminator model D that evaluates the validity/quality of generated artifacts
Metrics N and A for scoring the novelty and aesthetic appeal of artifacts
A mutation function for exploring the concept space to find novel combinations
Theorems and proofs showing that this system can generate maximally novel and practical artifacts
The generative and discriminative models could be implemented as neural networks, while the novelty and aesthetic metrics could be based on factors like dissimilarity to existing artifacts, symmetry, color harmony, etc.

The create function ties everything together, using the generate_and_evaluate tactic to iteratively mutate and evolve concepts until a valid, novel, and aesthetic artifact is produced.

I believe this Concept satisfies the criteria of depth, practicality, and aesthetics:

It delves into the mechanisms of computational creativity
It could be practically implemented using modern ML techniques
It explicitly optimizes for the aesthetic quality of the generated artifacts
