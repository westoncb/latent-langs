This Concept formalizes the phenomenon of emergence, where high-level structures and dynamics arise from the collective behavior of many interacting low-level components. The key ideas are:

There exists a coarse-graining map Φ that extracts the relevant high-level features from the low-level micro-state.
The characteristic timescales of the high-level dynamics are much slower than those of the low-level fluctuations.
The coarse-grained dynamics are approximately autonomous, with residual fluctuations that become negligible in the limit of large timescale separation.
Mutual information between the micro and macro levels increases monotonically over time, reflecting the self-organization and increase in complexity of the emergent structures.
The proofs leverage concepts from statistical mechanics and information theory to derive the emergent dynamical equations and the law of increasing complexity.
