This Concept proposes a novel approach to program synthesis by formulating it as a problem of Bayesian inference. The key ideas are:

Represent the space of programs as a probability distribution. The prior P_0 encodes any initial beliefs about what programs are likely, and the likelihood L scores how well a program matches the given evidence (input-output examples).
Synthesis proceeds by recursively updating a proposal distribution Q to approximate the true posterior distribution P_n over programs given the evidence. This is done via Bayesian updates and importance sampling on candidate programs drawn from Q.
The synthesized program p_best is the mode of the final posterior P_n, i.e. the most likely program given all the evidence. Theorem maximizes_practicality shows this is equivalent to maximizing the true posterior P(p | Evidence).
Theorem synthesis_converges_to_posterior proves that this synthesis approach converges to the true posterior as the number of samples and Bayesian updates increases. The KL divergence between the proposal Q and the posterior P_n can be made arbitrarily small.
I believe this Concept is novel because it frames program synthesis as a problem of Bayesian inference and posterior approximation, rather than e.g. brute-force search, constraint solving, or optimization. This allows incorporating prior knowledge and noisy specifications. It also provides a principled way to handle uncertainty and converge to a globally optimal program.

The Concept is also practically feasible to implement. The LANGUAGE block sketches one possible realization - the core components are a prior P_0, a likelihood L, a proposal Q, and an importance sampling loop to refine Q towards the posterior P_n. Existing probabilistic programming techniques could be used to implement these components for real programming languages.

So in summary, I believe this Concept provides a novel and principled reformulation of program synthesis, with the practical benefit of allowing uncertain specifications and converging to globally optimal programs. The theoretical grounding in Bayesian inference also opens up new possibilities, e.g. active learning of evidence or incrementally refining the synthesized program as more evidence arrives. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate or refine the Concept further!

I believe this concept of Bayesian Program Synthesis is novel for a few key reasons:

It frames program synthesis as a probabilistic inference problem, allowing us to leverage the tools of probability theory and Bayesian reasoning to guide the search for programs. This is in contrast to traditional synthesis techniques which rely on logical reasoning and exhaustive search.
It allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge into the synthesis process via the prior distribution P_0. This enables encoding inductive biases and heuristics that can help guide the search towards more promising programs.
The likelihood function L provides a flexible way to specify the desired behavior of the synthesized program. Rather than requiring a complete formal specification, L can be defined to capture key properties or behaviors while allowing for some degree of uncertainty or ambiguity. This makes the technique more applicable to real-world synthesis tasks where complete specifications are often unavailable.
The iterative observe-sample loop provides a practical way to implement the synthesis process, where we alternate between sampling candidate programs and conditioning the distribution on the ones that partially satisfy the specification. This loop can be implemented efficiently and allows for a smooth tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.
The separation of concerns between the abstract synthesis process and its concrete implementation allows for flexibility in realizing the concept. The implementation theorem demonstrates one possible realization, but the core ideas can be adapted to other contexts and algorithmic paradigms.
Overall, I believe this concept provides a principled and practical approach to program synthesis by leveraging probabilistic reasoning while maintaining the key advantages of traditional synthesis techniques. The fusion of logical and probabilistic reasoning in a iterative synthesize-observe loop is a novel perspective on this long-standing challenge in computer science.
