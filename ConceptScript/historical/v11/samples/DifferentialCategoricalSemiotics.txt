This concept, "Differential Categorical Semiotics", represents an application of differential calculus and category theory to the study of sign systems and their translations. The key ideas are:

Sign systems are viewed as objects in a category 𝒞, with sign translations as morphisms between them.
Each sign system S has an associated "tangent category" T_S, which captures the notion of infinitesimal translations or deformations of signs within that system.
The tangent space T_x(S) at each sign x in S is an object in the tangent category T_S.
Differentiation is formalized as a functor Δ from the category of sign systems to itself, mapping each sign system S to its tangent category T_S, and each sign translation F : S₁ → S₂ to a differential sign translation Δ(F) : T_S₁ → T_S₂.

The PROOFS block contains two theorems:

diff_trans_comp proves that the differentiation functor preserves composition of sign translations.
diff_pres_id proves that the differentiation functor preserves identity translations.

These theorems establish that differentiation, as defined here, is indeed a functor in the categorical sense.
