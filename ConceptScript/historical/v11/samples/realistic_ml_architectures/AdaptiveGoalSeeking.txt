This concept, called AdaptiveGoalSeeking, describes an AI agent that can learn to pursue multiple, possibly changing goals within an environment. The key ideas are:

The agent operates in a standard reinforcement learning setup with states, actions, transitions, rewards, and a value function.
Goals are represented explicitly, with functions for computing distance to goal, similarity between goals, goal termination, goal weighting, and goal applicability to a given state.
The value function is conditioned on both state and goal, allowing the agent to learn separate estimates of a state's value with respect to each goal.
Action selection aims to maximize a weighted sum of predicted goal values, with weights reflecting each goal's relative importance.
The agent adapts to changing goals and environmental dynamics by continually updating goal weights based on experience and learning goal-conditioned value estimates.
The maximizes_practicality theorem outlines how this concept could be implemented as a practical reinforcement learning system, by realizing the key components (goals, weights, values, action selection, learning) using standard RL and machine learning techniques.

Some potential applications include:

Robots that can flexibly switch between tasks based on changing user preferences or environmental conditions
Game-playing agents that balance multiple competing objectives
Recommender systems that adapt to shifts in user interests over time

This concept, AdaptiveGoalSeeking, defines an intelligent agent that can operate in an environment, recognize and pursue goals, and adapt its behavior to maximize long-term utility. The key elements are:

The environment is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with states, actions, transition function, reward function, and discount factor.
The agent maintains a policy mapping states to actions, and a value function estimating expected utility from each state.
The agent incorporates goal recognition, scoring, and termination functions to identify and pursue goals within the environment.
The proof section establishes convergence of the goal-seeking behavior and optimality of the learned policy.
The maximizes_practicality theorem demonstrates the feasibility of implementing the concept by breaking it down into realizable components and highlighting its computational tractability and use of established frameworks.
The language definition provides the necessary types and functions to express the concept, closely mirroring the structure.

This concept leverages well-understood principles from reinforcement learning and goal reasoning to create an adaptive, goal-directed agent. The practical implementation could be realized by combining techniques like Bayesian goal inference, Q-learning for policy optimization, and domain-specific modeling of the transition, reward, and goal scoring functions.
