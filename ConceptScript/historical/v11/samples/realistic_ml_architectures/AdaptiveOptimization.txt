This concept, called AdaptiveOptimization, represents a general framework for solving complex optimization problems using an adaptive, intelligent agent. The key ideas are:

The agent maintains a surrogate model that approximates the problem landscape and guides the search process.
The agent adapts its search strategy based on the information gained from evaluating points in the search space and updating the surrogate model.

The adaptive_optimization_convergence theorem states that, under certain conditions, the agent will converge to an optimal solution within a given tolerance. This provides a theoretical foundation for the effectiveness of the approach.
