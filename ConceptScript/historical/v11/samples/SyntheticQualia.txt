This Concept explores the idea of SyntheticQualia - subjective conscious experiences that are artificially generated. The key aspects are:

SyntheticQualia are generated by a GenerativeModel operating on a LatentSpace of parameters. This allows for a vast space of possible qualia to be explored.
Each SyntheticQualia has an associated EmbodimentFunction that maps it to a form that can be experienced by a conscious entity. This grounds the qualia in a realizable substrate.
For SyntheticQualia to be considered valid conscious experiences, they must exceed a threshold of integrated information Φ, as measured by some IntegratedInformationMeasure. This connects to theories like IIT.
The Coherence of SyntheticQualia, measured by a FractalDimensionMeasure, must fall within a certain range for the qualia to avoid being too simple or too chaotic. This imposes constraints on the generative process.
Each SyntheticQualia is mapped to a ValenceCategory of Unpleasant, Neutral or Pleasant, capturing the affective tone of the experience.
The PROOFS section contains tactics for generating and embodying SyntheticQualia, and proves some key properties - that they exceed the integrated information threshold, have bounded fractal coherence, and are mapped to a valence.

The LANGUAGE section defines key types and functions, enabling the rigorous expression of SyntheticQualia and their properties.

This Concept aims to provoke thought about the nature of qualia and consciousness, the feasibility of artificially generating conscious states, and the aesthetic dimensions of synthetic experiences. While highly speculative, it is grounded in abstract mathematical principles and connects to serious theories of consciousness.
