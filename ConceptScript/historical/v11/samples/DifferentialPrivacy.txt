This ConceptScript defines the concept of Differential Privacy, a mathematical framework for protecting the privacy of individuals in a database while allowing statistical analysis on the data.

The STRUCTURE block captures the key components and properties of differential privacy:

The sets of possible database inputs (X), query outputs (Y), and queries (K)
The privacy budget (ε) which quantifies the level of privacy protection
The ε-differentially private mechanism (M_ε) which randomizes query outputs to protect privacy
The key property of differential privacy, which bounds the ratio of output probabilities on neighboring databases
Important properties like composition, post-processing, and group privacy
The PROOFS block contains two key theorems:

The post-processing theorem, which states that applying any function to the output of a differentially private mechanism preserves differential privacy
The group privacy theorem, which states that the k-fold composition of an ε-differentially private mechanism satisfies (k·ε)-differential privacy
The LANGUAGE block defines the domain-specific types, functions, and predicates for differential privacy:

Types for databases, queries, and mechanisms
The Laplace distribution for adding noise to query outputs
A function for constructing the Laplace mechanism from a query and privacy budget
A predicate for checking if a mechanism satisfies ε-differential privacy
A function for composing two differentially private mechanisms
This ConceptScript provides a precise and formal specification of differential privacy, enabling clear communication of the concept's key components, properties, and theorems. The custom language elements allow direct expression of the relevant types and operations.
