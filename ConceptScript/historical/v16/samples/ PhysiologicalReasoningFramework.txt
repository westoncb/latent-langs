The key changes and additions:

Introduced quantitative types and functions for representing physiological quantities, rates, thresholds, concentrations, flows, pressures, volumes, etc. This allows modeling of more concrete biophysical relationships.
Added temporal logic operators (Always, Eventually, Until, Happens) for reasoning about time-dependent properties and events.
Refined the representation of causal relationships, distinguishing direct causes from mechanistically-mediated causal chains.
Modified the feedback and regulation axioms to incorporate quantitative relationships between rates of change.
Expanded the proof section with theorems about function localization, causal transitivity, and the quantitative dynamics of regulatory feedback control.

These changes make the framework more expressive and better suited for modeling the kinds of quantitative, temporal, and mechanistic details that are essential for understanding complex physiological systems. The added specificity supports more precise and rigorous reasoning about the dynamics of health and disease.
