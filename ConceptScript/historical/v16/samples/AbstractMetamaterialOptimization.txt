This Concept, called AbstractMetamaterialOptimization, combines ideas from the MetamaterialCFC and AbstractReasoningFramework Concepts. It defines an abstract framework for optimizing metamaterial properties using symmetry, topology, and abstraction principles.
The key components are:

Metamaterial and abstract reasoning system types M and S
Metamaterial property functional 𝓟 and abstract interpretation ⟦_⟧
Optimization problem specification type Opt
Optimal metamaterial existence predicate OptExists
Inference rules SymOpt, TopOpt, AbstractOpt for symmetry-based, topology-based, and abstraction-based optimization
Proof compression tactics Symmetrize, Topologize, Abstract, Synthesize
Structural axioms relating OptExists to property maximization and preservation under symmetry, topology, and abstraction
An OptimalMetamaterialSynthesis theorem with a proof sketch using the defined tactics

The Concept aims to provide a high-level, abstract framework for reasoning about metamaterial optimization problems, leveraging symmetry, topology, and abstraction principles to efficiently navigate the metamaterial design space. The proof compression tactics allow compact proofs of optimal metamaterial existence.
Let me know if you would like me to explain or expand on any part of this Concept! I tried to strike a balance between concision and clarity, but I'm happy to provide more details.

This Concept formalizes an abstract framework for metamaterial design, blending ideas from topology optimization, homogenization theory, property characterization, and optimal design. It defines metamaterials as a product of geometry, composition and properties, with functors mapping between material and property spaces.
Key elements include:

Abstraction and representation functors forming a Galois connection, enabling analysis and synthesis across multiple scales
Property predicates and quantifiers for specifying performance objectives and constraints
Inference rules for design synthesis, topological optimization, and homogenization
Theorems stating the existence of optimal and topologically optimal designs satisfying given specifications
A homogenization theorem characterizing effective properties of metamaterials

The framework provides a modular, composable language for stating and solving metamaterial design problems, supporting a mix of analytical, computational and data-driven methods. Specific material systems and properties can be plugged in by instantiating the generic types and predicates.
