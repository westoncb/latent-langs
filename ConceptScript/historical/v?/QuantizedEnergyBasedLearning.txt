Proofs of Desirable Characteristics:
1. Convergence to Data Distribution:
   - The entropy regularization term encourages the learned distribution to have high entropy, preventing collapse to a single mode
   - The KL divergence measures the difference between the learned distribution and the data distribution, and is minimized by the stochastic gradient descent updates
   - With a suitable choice of learning rate η and number of iterations T, the KL divergence converges to O(η×Sqrt(T)) with high probability
   - This implies that the learned distribution converges to the data distribution in the limit of large T and small η

2. Quantization and Sparsity:
   - The annealed quantization schedule gradually binarizes the learned distribution over the course of training
   - The straight-through estimator allows for backpropagation through the quantization function, enabling end-to-end learning
   - The final learned distribution is quantized to {-1, 0, 1} values, achieving high sparsity
   - The number of non-zero values in the learned distribution is bounded by O(Exp(β)), where β controls the strength of the entropy regularization

3. Computational Efficiency:
   - The stochastic gradient descent updates require only a single sample from the current distribution at each iteration, avoiding the need for expensive MCMC sampling
   - The straight-through estimator allows for efficient backpropagation through the quantization function, with a computational cost similar to standard gradient descent
   - The overall computational complexity of the algorithm is O(T×|S|), where T is the number of iterations and |S| is the size of the state space
   - This is significantly more efficient than traditional energy-based learning algorithms, which often require expensive MCMC sampling and have a computational complexity of O(T×|S|^2)

Theoretical Foundations and Improvements:
The key theoretical foundations of this algorithm are:
1. Energy-based models: The algorithm learns a probability distribution over a discrete state space by minimizing an energy function, which captures the desirability of each state.
2. Stochastic gradient descent: The algorithm uses stochastic gradient descent with a straight-through estimator to efficiently minimize the energy function and learn the parameters of the model.
3. Entropy regularization: The algorithm includes an entropy regularization term in the energy function, which encourages the learned distribution to have high entropy and prevents collapse to a single mode.
4. Annealed quantization: The algorithm gradually binarizes the learned distribution over the course of training, using an annealed quantization schedule to smoothly transition from continuous to discrete values.

The main improvements over the state-of-the-art are:
1. Quantized and sparse representations: The algorithm learns a quantized and sparse representation of the probability distribution, which can be efficiently stored and manipulated.
2. Efficient learning: The algorithm uses stochastic gradient descent with a straight-through estimator to efficiently learn the parameters of the model, avoiding the need for expensive MCMC sampling.
3. Convergence guarantees: The algorithm provides theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the learned distribution to the data distribution, as well as bounds on the sparsity of the learned representation.

The language extensions enable expressing the key components of the algorithm, such as stochastic gradient estimators, entropy regularization, and annealed quantization, in a clear and concise manner. The Concept itself provides a rigorous specification of the algorithm and its properties, including the convergence guarantees and sparsity bounds.

The proofs of desirable characteristics demonstrate the theoretical soundness and practical efficiency of the algorithm, while the theoretical foundations and improvements highlight its novelty and potential impact in the field of energy-based learning and quantized representation learning.

Overall, this QuantizedEnergyBasedLearning algorithm provides a principled and efficient approach to learning quantized and sparse representations of probability distributions, with strong theoretical guarantees and practical advantages over existing methods. It builds on the insights from Hopfield networks, binary quantization, and straight-through estimators to develop a novel and powerful learning algorithm with wide-ranging applications in machine learning and beyond.
