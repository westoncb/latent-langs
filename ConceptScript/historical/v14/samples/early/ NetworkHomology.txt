      ω ∈ ker(HodgeLaplacian(1)(N.Complex))  by definition of HarmonicForms
      ω ∉ img(BoundaryOperator(2)(N.Complex))  
        because ∀ e, ω(e.Source) = ω(e.Target), so ω is not a coboundary
      ω ∉ img(CoboundaryOperator(0)(N.Complex))
        because CoboundaryOperator(0) = 0 by definition
      
      So ker(HodgeLaplacian(1)(N.Complex)) ≠ {0}
      Thus BettiNumber(1)(N.Complex) > 0  by HodgeDecomposition axiom
      
      // Backward direction
      assume BettiNumber(1)(N.Complex) > 0
      let ω ∈ ker(HodgeLaplacian(1)(N.Complex)) - {0}  by HodgeDecomposition axiom
      
      ∀ e ∈ N.Edges, ω(e.Source) = ω(e.Target)  
        because ω is harmonic, so dω = δω = 0
      
      So Synchronizable(N)  by definition

        ∀ p: Path(N), ∫_p ω = 0  by definition of Diffusive
        
      So ∀ k>0, HarmonicForms(k)(N.Complex) = {0}
      Thus ∀ k>0, dim(HarmonicForms(k)(N.Complex)) = 0
      So ∀ k>0, BettiNumber(k)(N.Complex) = 0  by HarmonicBettiTheorem
      
      // Backward direction
      assume ∀ k>0, BettiNumber(k)(N.Complex) = 0
      
      ∀ k>0, dim(HarmonicForms(k)(N.Complex)) = 0  by HarmonicBettiTheorem
      So ∀ k>0, HarmonicForms(k)(N.Complex) = {0}
      
      Thus ∀ k>0, ∀ ω ∈ HarmonicForms(k)(N.Complex), ω = 0  
      So ∀ p: Path(N), ∫_p ω = 0

META {
  Discrete exterior calculus provides a powerful framework for analyzing the topological and geometric 
  structure of discrete spaces, such as complex networks. By studying the chain complexes and homology
  groups associated to a network, we can gain insights into its connectivity, robustness, and dynamics.
  
  The key idea is to model a network as a simplicial complex, where nodes are 0-simplices, edges are 
  1-simplices, triangles are 2-simplices, etc. We can then define discrete differential forms on this
  complex and study their flow and interaction using the tools of exterior calculus.
  
  The main proof strategy will be to relate the homological properties of the network, such as its Betti
  numbers and harmonic forms, to its functional properties, such as its synchronizability and diffusion 
  capacity. We will use the Hodge decomposition theorem and the Hodge Laplacian to derive these connections.
