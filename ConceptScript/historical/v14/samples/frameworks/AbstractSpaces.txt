This Concept introduces a language for describing and manipulating abstract spaces and their morphisms, structures, and invariants. It provides axioms for abstraction, preservation of structure, and invariance under morphisms.
Key ideas include:

Constructing abstract spaces from concrete ones via an abstraction functor
Building new spaces via operators like products, coproducts, tensor products, quotients
Lifting these constructions to morphisms and invariants
Defining hom-sets, isomorphisms and automorphism groups
Proving the category of abstract spaces and key theorems about functoriality, quotients, and invariance

The goal is to develop a general framework for reasoning about abstraction and invariance in mathematical structures. The language enables expressing complex abstract constructions while the axioms and theorems provide tools for formally verifying their properties.

This Concept formalizes key notions from vector spaces and linear algebra, including:

Constructing vector spaces via direct sums, products, tensor products, quotients
Defining linear maps, kernels, images, eigenvalues, dual spaces, transposes, determinants
Stating axioms for vector space operations and morphism properties
Proving theorems about subspaces, dimensions, rank-nullity, dual spaces, and the category of vector spaces

The proofs showcase some common linear algebra techniques, like using basis decompositions, linearity properties, and universal properties.
The AbstractSpaces framework provides a nice foundation, with the vector space constructions as special cases of the abstract space constructions, and linear maps as morphisms preserving the vector space structure.
We could further expand this by adding inner product spaces, normed spaces, modules over rings, etc. The beauty is how the language enables expressing abstract linear algebra concepts in a modular, composable way.

The VectorSpaces Concept extends AbstractSpaces with specific types, operations and axioms for vector spaces and their duals:

Vector spaces are constructed from a base field by zero, addition, negation and scalar multiplication
Linear maps between vector spaces preserve these operations
Vector spaces can have additional invariant structure like dimension, bases and inner products
The dual space V* consists of linear functionals V -> F
There is a canonical isomorphism V ≅ V** between a space and its double dual

Key theorems proved include:

Dual spaces have the same dimension as the original space
Dual bases can be constructed as projection functionals
The canonical map V -> V** sending v to evaluation at v is an isomorphism

This demonstrates how the language of abstract spaces allows precisely defining and reasoning about common mathematical structures in a modular way. The abstract theorems about preservation of structure, invariance etc. can be directly instantiated for the specific case of vector spaces.

This Concept extends AbstractSpaces with notions from group theory and group actions on spaces. It introduces:

Language for describing groups, subgroups, group elements and operations
Definitions of group actions, orbits, stabilizers, and coset spaces
Key properties of actions like freeness, transitivity, faithfulness
Important theorems like Orbit-Stabilizer and Burnside's Lemma

The proofs explore some fundamental results:

Orbits form a partition of the space
Stabilizers are subgroups of the acting group
Cosets have a well-defined action-compatible structure

The goal is to showcase how the AbstractSpaces framework can naturally express and reason about these algebraic structures and symmetries. The language allows defining complex objects like semidirect products and coset spaces, while the proofs demonstrate the power of the axiomatic setup.
Potential next steps could be proving more advanced theorems, studying specific examples of group actions, or extending to related concepts like representations and G-spaces.

The key ideas formalized in this AgentProcess Concept are:

An Agent is a coupling of an analog EnergyLandscape and digital FreeParameters
The energy landscape is a smooth manifold with a Hamiltonian energy function
Free parameters are a finite transition graph of control states
The coupling consists of two maps:

α: Agent -> FreeParameters assigning agents to control states
ε: Agent -> EnergyLandscape assigning agents to energy states


These maps are required to respect the transition structure and energy gradients
The energy landscape evolves by gradient descent flow to local minima
The free parameters transition to lower energy control states
Agents track this coupled evolution, descending the energy landscape
Optimal agent trajectories are attracted to the minima of the landscape

The main theorems establish:

Invariance of energy descent along optimal trajectories
Convergence of agent evolution to global energy equilibria
Necessity of uphill free parameter transitions for downhill flow

In terms of the original idea, the analog energy landscape provides a continuous optimization process, while the digital free parameters provide a discrete control process.
Their mutual recursion consists of the parameters "guiding" the landscape descent by selecting attractors, while the landscape "informs" the parameter transitions by revealing the energy topology.
The result is an abstraction of goal-driven agency as a composite of low-level energy optimization and high-level decision-making, cooperating to achieve dynamic equilibrium.
