This Concept aims to provide a general framework for studying differential structures on noncommutative algebras and their cohomological and geometric properties. Key ideas:

Generalizes differential forms to noncommutative algebras using the concept of a differential graded algebra (DGA) Ω(A).
Introduces connections ∇ and curvature R on Ω(A), generalizing Riemannian geometry.
Relates the de Rham cohomology of Ω(A) to Hochschild and cyclic cohomology of A.
Introduces a "Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) geometry" on Ω(A) with operators (d,Δ) and pairing ⟨-,-⟩.
Proves noncommutative versions of major theorems: de Rham theorem, Atiyah-Singer index theorem, Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
Provides uniqueness and local triviality results for flat connections, generalizing theorems from differential geometry.

The goal is to have a flexible symbolic framework for reasoning about the differential topology and geometry of noncommutative spaces in a way that lines up with classical results.

Key ideas:

Formulate the Hodge conjecture in terms of the cycle class map cl: Z^r(X) -> H^{2r}(X, ℤ) from codimension r algebraic cycles to even degree cohomology.
Use the Hodge decomposition H^k(X, ℂ) ≅ ⨁H^{p,q}(X) and Hodge symmetry to isolate the relevant piece H^{r,r}(X) ⊆ H^{2r}(X, ℂ).
Prove the integral Hodge conjecture by showing surjectivity of cl ⊗ ℚ onto H^{2r}(X, ℚ) ∩ H^{r,r}(X) using a Poincaré duality argument.
Deduce the rational Hodge conjecture using Hodge symmetry to show H^{2r}(X, ℚ) ∩ (⨁_{p≠q} H^{p,q}(X)) = 0.

The main gap is the arithmetic part of showing certain pairings give algebraic cycle classes, which is the deep part of the conjecture. But structurally this gives an outline of attack.
Some other ideas: Treat the derived category of coherent sheaves DbCoh(X) as a "noncommutative motive" and try to construct a "motivic Chern character" map K(X) ⊗ ℚ -> H^*(X, ℚ) factoring the cycle class map. Or use Deligne-Beilinson cohomology as a finer receptacle for algebraic cycles than singular cohomology.
Broadly, thinking of cohomology and cycle spaces as receptacles for differential/symbolic structures with rich algebra could provide new tools to chip away at the problem. The SymbolicDifferentialAlgebras framework gives an algebraic perspective to organize that.
