  LEMMA BottPeriodicityAHSS:
    E(K^*(ΩU)) ≅ { ℤ[β^±1]  for p=0 and q even,
                   0        otherwise }
    where E is the AHSS for K^*(ΩU) and deg(β) = 2
  {
    ; Set up the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence  
    let X := ΩU 
    have E²_p,q := H_p(ΩU; K_q(𝟙))  ; E₂ page
    
    ; Compute the E₂ page using known facts:
    ; - π_odd(U) = 0 and π_even(U) = ℤ
    ; - H_*(ΩU; ℤ) is a polynomial algebra ℤ[β] on a generator β in degree 2
    ; - K_*(𝟙) is ℤ in even degrees and 0 in odd degrees
    have E²_p,q = {  ℤ  for p,q even  
                     0  otherwise    }
      
    ; The spectral sequence collapses at E₂  
    have d_r = 0 for all r ≥ 2
    hence E_∞ = E²
    
    ; Identify the multiplicative structure
    have β ∈ E²_{2,0} represents the Bott element
    have E²_*,0 = ℤ[β] and E²_0,* = ℤ[β^-1]
    so E_∞ ≅ ℤ[β^±1]
  }
  
  THEOREM BottPeriodicity: 
    π_k(U) ≅ π_(k+2)(U)
  {
    ; Compute K^*(ΩU) using the AHSS 
    have K^*(ΩU) ≅ ℤ[β^±1]  by BottPeriodicityAHSS
      where deg(β) = 2
      
    ; Deduce K^*(U) from Bott periodicity of K^*(ΩU)  
    have adj: K^*(ΩX) ≅ K^*(Σ(X))[-1]
    have K^*(U) ≅ Σ K^*(ΩU) ≅ ℤ[β^±1]
    
    ; Represent K^*(U) using homotopy groups
    have BU × ℤ = Ω^∞(KU) = colim_n Ω^(2n)(U)
      where KU is the K-theory spectrum and BU = colim_n Gr_n(ℂ^∞)
    so π_*(BU) ≅ π_*(U)[β^±1] ≅ K^*(U)
    thus π_k(U) ≅ π_(k+2)(U)  
  }

This proof leverages several features of our Concept:

Importing the base AlgebraicTopology Concept to use its types, axioms, and theorems.
Setting up the AHSS using the general construction and identifying the E₂ page.
Collapsing the spectral sequence using degree arguments and known computations.
Deducing Bott periodicity of K^(U) from K^(ΩU) using loop space adjunction.
Translating between generalized cohomology and homotopy groups using representing spaces.

The high-level tactics and notation help structure the proof while suppressing technical details. Of course, to make this fully rigorous, we'd need to formalize notions of spectra, generalized cohomology theories, and more within the AlgebraicTopology Concept. But this sketch demonstrates how the framework enables expressing sophisticated arguments fluidly.
Bott periodicity is a fundamental result with significant implications, so this formalization is valuable in its own right. Moreover, it illustrates the potential for the AlgebraicTopology Concept to handle complex theories and proofs that integrate various aspects of the field.
