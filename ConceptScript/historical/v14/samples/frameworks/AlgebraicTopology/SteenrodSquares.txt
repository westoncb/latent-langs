      let i: B ↪ E be the zero section, so i^*(U) = 0
      consider Sq(i^*(U)) = i^*(Sq(U))

      have U ⌣: Ker i^* ≅ H^*(B; 𝔽₂)  ; Thom isomorphism
      let κ ∈ H^*(B; 𝔽₂) be the unique class with Sq(U) - χ(ξ) ⌣ U = κ ⌣ U

Here, the Steenrod squares are defined axiomatically using the Cartan and Adem relations, and some of their key properties like instability and behavior on Thom classes are proved. The Wu formula is stated but its proof is only sketched, as it requires more elaborate machinery.
Expressing and proving these results in a traditional setting would require introducing a significant amount of background material on cohomology operations, Postnikov towers, Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, and more. The AlgebraicTopology Concept provides a streamlined context where the key structures are already available and the proofs can focus on the essential ideas.
