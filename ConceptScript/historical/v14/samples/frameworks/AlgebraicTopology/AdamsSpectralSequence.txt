This formalization showcases several key aspects:

We define the category of spectra and modules over algebras, which are needed to set up the Adams spectral sequence.
We construct the Steenrod algebra 𝔸 using the cohomology of a point and tensor product and composition operations.
We state the existence of Adams resolutions approximating a spectrum X by simpler spectra X_i built from Eilenberg-MacLane spectra. This is a key input for the spectral sequence.
We define the E₂ term of the Adams spectral sequence as an Ext group over the Steenrod algebra.
We construct the Adams spectral sequence from the homotopy exact couple of an Adams resolution and identify its E₂ page and convergence properties.
As an example, we compute the first few stable homotopy groups of spheres by calculating Ext groups over a subalgebra A₂ of the Steenrod algebra, analyzing differentials and extensions in the spectral sequence.

The proof of the main theorem sketches the key steps while omitting some technical details, which could be further formalized using the language and tactics of the AlgebraicTopology Concept.
The example computation illustrates a typical "user-level" application of the Adams spectral sequence, showcasing its power in a concrete case. The calculation involves a careful analysis of the algebraic structure of the Ext groups and the behavior of differentials, demonstrating the intricacy of the method.
Overall, this formalization provides a high-level view of the Adams spectral sequence and its use in computing stable homotopy groups, while hinting at the vast amount of algebraic topology machinery that underlies it. With further work, one could imagine formalizing the full details of the construction and leveraging it to compute stable homotopy groups in a more automated fashion.
This example pushes the boundaries of what our AlgebraicTopology Concept can express, touching on advanced topics like spectra, generalized cohomology theories, and the intricacies of the Steenrod algebra. It demonstrates the potential for this framework to serve as a foundation for cutting-edge research in computational homotopy theory.
