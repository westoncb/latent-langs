This Concept defines a general notion of structured spaces and morphisms between them. It introduces a language for expressing various constructions on spaces like products, coproducts, and monoidal structures. The structural rules specify how structures interact with these constructions.
Key ideas are captured in proofs about universal properties, functorial semantics (Yoneda lemma), and adjunctions. The proofs demonstrate that structured spaces and structure-preserving maps form a category, and that categories related by adjoint functors are equivalent.
The Concept aims to serve as a unifying framework for reasoning about topology, algebra, geometry, etc. in terms of structured spaces and morphisms. The goal is to elucidate deep connections between seemingly disparate mathematical domains through the common language of category theory.
