This Concept defines a self-optimizing adaptive system consisting of programmable matter components organized in an adaptive topology. The system has dynamics governed by a sense-plan-act program operating in an environment consisting of tasks and a world model.
Key ideas synthesized from the prior Concepts include:

Computational matter components from ComputationalMatter_v1
Adaptive assembly topologies from AdaptiveStructure_v1
Formalization of optimization with respect to a metric
Tactics and theorems supporting component and topology optimization
Inference of optimal programs from observation of system trajectories
Proof of self-optimization and adaptivity under certain assumptions
