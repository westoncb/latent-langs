This Concept blends ideas from noncommutative geometry and symbolic differential geometry to develop a theory of "Symbolic Noncommutative Differential Geometry". It introduces noncommutative analogues of manifolds, Riemannian metrics, Lie groups, symplectic structures, and Hilbert spaces, all built from noncommutative algebras.
Key constructions include product and quotient noncommutative geometries, Hilbert modules equipped with connections, and differential calculi satisfying abstract Stokes' theorem. Connes' noncommutative geometry is recovered from a spectral triple.
Proofs are given for the existence and uniqueness of the differential calculus associated to a spectral triple, a noncommutative Stokes' theorem, the behavior of connections under gauge transformations, and the existence of KMS states (a version of the noncommutative Frobenius theorem).
The language introduces notation for composing algebras, quotienting by ideals, Lie derivatives, exterior derivatives, noncommutative integrals and inner products, modular operators, and more. Predicates are defined for algebra representations, algebra functors, and spectral triples.
