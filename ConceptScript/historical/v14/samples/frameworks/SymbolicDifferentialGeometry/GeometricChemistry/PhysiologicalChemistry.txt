  PROOFS {
    theorem SteadyStateApproximation(E: Enzyme, S: Substrate, P: Product):
      MichaelisMenten(E, S, P) under the assumptions:
        d[ES]/dt = 0 and [E]₀ = [E] + [ES]
    {
      let k₁, k₋₁, k_cat be the rate constants for E + S ⇌ ES → E + P
      have d[ES]/dt = k₁ * [E] * [S] - (k₋₁ + k_cat) * [ES]
      assume d[ES]/dt = 0  ; Steady state approximation
      hence k₁ * [E] * [S] = (k₋₁ + k_cat) * [ES] = k₋₁ * [ES] + k_cat * [ES]
      
      let K_M = (k₋₁ + k_cat) / k₁ be the Michaelis constant
      have [E]₀ = [E] + [ES]  ; Conservation of total enzyme
      have [E] = [E]₀ - [ES]
      
      substitute:
        k₁ * ([E]₀ - [ES]) * [S] = k₋₁ * [ES] + k_cat * [ES]
        k₁ * [E]₀ * [S] - k₁ * [ES] * [S] = k₋₁ * [ES] + k_cat * [ES]
        k₁ * [E]₀ * [S] = k₋₁ * [ES] + k_cat * [ES] + k₁ * [ES] * [S] = (k₋₁ + k_cat) * [ES] + k₁ * [ES] * [S]
          = K_M * k₁ * [ES] + k₁ * [ES] * [S]  ; By definition of K_M
          = k₁ * [ES] * (K_M + [S])
      
      hence k₁ * [E]₀ * [S] = k₁ * [ES] * (K_M + [S])
      hence [ES] = [E]₀ * [S] / (K_M + [S])
      
      let v = k_cat * [ES] be the reaction velocity
      hence v = k_cat * [E]₀ * [S] / (K_M + [S])

    theorem ElectrochemicalEquilibrium(Ion: Molecule, Compartment1: Compartment, Compartment2: Compartment):
      NernstEquation(Ion, Compartment1, Compartment2) at equilibrium
    {
      let z be the charge of Ion
      let [Ion]₁ and [Ion]₂ be the concentrations of Ion in Compartment1 and Compartment2
      let E be the voltage difference between Compartment1 and Compartment2
      
      at equilibrium:
        μ₁ = μ₂  ; Equality of electrochemical potentials
        μ₁⁰ + R * T * ln([Ion]₁) + z * F * ϕ₁ = μ₂⁰ + R * T * ln([Ion]₂) + z * F * ϕ₂
          ; Electrochemical potential as a function of chemical potential μ⁰, concentration [Ion], and electric potential ϕ
      
      assume μ₁⁰ = μ₂⁰  ; Same standard chemical potential
      have E = ϕ₂ - ϕ₁  ; Definition of voltage difference
      
      rearrange:
        R * T * ln([Ion]₁) + z * F * ϕ₁ = R * T * ln([Ion]₂) + z * F * ϕ₂
        R * T * ln([Ion]₁) - R * T * ln([Ion]₂) = z * F * ϕ₂ - z * F * ϕ₁
        R * T * ln([Ion]₁ / [Ion]₂) = z * F * (ϕ₂ - ϕ₁)  
        R * T * ln([Ion]₁ / [Ion]₂) = z * F * E
      hence E = (R * T / (z * F)) * ln([Ion]₂ / [Ion]₁)
