    theorem QuantumClassicalCorrespondence(ρ: DensityMatrix, P: ProbabilityDistribution):
      ρ(t) ≈ ∫ P(q, p; t) * |q⟩⟨p| dq dp
    {
      assume ρ(t) = U(t) * ρ(0) * U(t)⁻¹  ; Unitary evolution
      
      let ρ(0) = ∫∫ ρ(q, p; 0) * |q⟩⟨p| dq dp  ; Wigner transform at t=0
      let U_qp(t) = ⟨q|U(t)|p⟩ be the propagator kernel
      
      have ρ(t) = ∫∫ ρ(q, p; 0) * U_qp(t) * |q⟩⟨p| * U_qp(t)⁻¹ dq dp
               = ∫∫ P(q, p; t) * |q⟩⟨p| dq dp
      where P(q, p; t) = ρ(q, p; 0) * |U_qp(t)|²
      
      hence ρ(t) ≈ ∫ P(q, p; t) * |q⟩⟨p| dq dp

    theorem GeometricPhase(A: U(1)Connection, C: ClosedPath, ψ: Wavefunction):
      let γ = ∮_C A = i * ∮_C ⟨ψ|d/dR|ψ⟩ dR, then:
      ψ_C = exp(i*γ) * ψ_0
    {    
      assume ∇_R × A = 0  ; Vanishing curvature
      have d(exp(i*∫_C A)) = exp(i*∫_C A) * (i*∮_C A)  ; Stokes' theorem
      
      let g(R) = exp(i*∫_{R_0}^R A)
      have ψ(R) = g(R) * ψ_0 by parallel transport
      hence ψ_C = g(C) * ψ_0 = exp(i*∮_C A) * ψ_0
      
      therefore, ψ_C = exp(i*γ) * ψ_0

    theorem DensityMatrixDynamics(ρ: DensityMatrix, 𝓗: ElectronicHamiltonian):
      let 𝓛 = [𝓗, •], then:
      ρ(t) = exp(-i*𝓛*t/ħ) * ρ(0)
    {
      assume ∂ρ/∂t = -i/ħ * [𝓗, ρ]  ; Liouville equation

      using [H_ad, |ψ_n⟩] = 0, ⟨ψ_m|∇_R|ψ_n⟩ ≈ 0, and multiplying by ⟨ψ_m|:
      
      i*ħ*∂c_m/∂t ≈ -(ħ²/(2*M)) * (⟨∇_R ψ_m|∇_R ψ_m⟩ + ⟨ψ_m|∇²_R|ψ_m⟩) * c_m
      
      therefore, i*ħ*∂|ψ_n⟩/∂t ≈ (H_ad + T_n)|ψ_n⟩

This Concept, QuantumChemicalDynamics, extends GeometricChemistry to incorporate time evolution and quantum dynamics. It introduces types for time-dependent states, trajectories, propagators, and observables. The key structural elements include:

TimeEvolution, which defines the unitary propagator in terms of the time-ordered exponential of the Hamiltonian.
QuantumLiouville, expressing the evolution of the density matrix under the Liouvillian superoperator.
EhrenbestTheorem, relating the dynamics of observable expectation values to the commutator with the Hamiltonian.
AdiabaticTheorem, connecting the slow nuclear motion on the potential energy surface to the fast electronic dynamics.
BerryPhase, defining the geometric phase acquired by the wavefunction along an adiabatic cycle.
MarcusTheory, a model for predicting electron transfer reaction rates from thermodynamic parameters.
TullyHoppingAlgorithm, a surface hopping method for modeling non-adiabatic transitions.

The proofs explore several fundamental aspects of quantum dynamics:

QuantumClassicalCorrespondence derives the semiclassical limit of the density matrix in terms of the Wigner phase space distribution.
GeometricPhase demonstrates how the wavefunction acquires a phase factor determined by the holonomy of the Berry connection.
DensityMatrixDynamics solves the Liouville equation using the propagator defined by the Liouvillian superoperator.
AdiabaticDynamics derives the effective Hamiltonian governing the slow nuclear motion on a single adiabatic potential energy surface.

The Concept aims to provide a mathematical framework for reasoning about coupled electron-nuclear dynamics, non-adiabatic processes, and semiclassical approximations in quantum chemistry, blending differential geometry with quantum mechanics.
