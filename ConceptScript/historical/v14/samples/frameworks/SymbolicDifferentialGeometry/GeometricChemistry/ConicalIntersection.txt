This Concept introduces the notion of a conical intersection as a point of degeneracy between two potential energy surfaces, and formalizes some of the key mathematical properties and dynamical consequences of these objects.
The language section defines a conical intersection as a tuple consisting of a molecule, two potential energy functions, and the submanifold where they intersect. It also introduces the Berry phase, which is a geometric phase acquired by the electronic state as it evolves along a loop around the intersection.
The structure section lists some important equations related to conical intersections:

The gradient difference coupling, which measures the strength of the coupling between the two states in terms of the gradient of their energy difference.
The geometrical phase theorem, which expresses the final state after a loop in terms of the initial state, the Berry phase, and the holonomy transport.
The Landau-Zener formula, which gives the transition probability between the two states in terms of the coupling strength and the velocity at the intersection.

The proofs section contains two theorems that highlight the geometric and topological aspects of conical intersections:

The conical intersection topology theorem, which shows that the intersection locally looks like a cone in the branching space, i.e., the subspace spanned by the gradient of the energy difference.
The Berry curvature theorem, which relates the curvature of the Krasovsky-Zener-Wilczek-Zee connection (a generalization of the Berry connection) to the exterior derivative of the electronic states, evaluated at the intersection.

These results demonstrate the power of combining differential geometry and quantum mechanics to study the complex behavior of molecules near conical intersections. The geometric language allows us to clearly identify the relevant structures (vector bundles, connections, curvatures) and to prove general theorems about their properties.
The use of a formal Concept with axioms, definitions, and proofs also enables us to reason abstractly about conical intersections, without getting bogged down in the details of specific molecules or electronic structure methods. We can derive consequences from the basic assumptions, explore the logical dependencies between statements, and potentially discover new results or generalizations.
Overall, I believe this example illustrates the potential of using a framework like GeometricChemistry to express and reason about sophisticated concepts in theoretical chemistry, in a way that is both mathematically rigorous and semantically meaningful. The symbolic language provides a clear and compact representation of the key ideas, while the inferential structure allows us to draw insights and conclusions from the definitions and axioms.
Of course, this is just a small taste of what is possible with this approach. One could imagine extending the Concept to include other aspects of non-adiabatic dynamics, such as surface hopping algorithms, mean-field equations, or semiclassical approximations. One could also connect it to related fields like geometric phase theory, gauge theory, or symplectic geometry, to gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations.

This Concept extends GeometricChemistry to study conical intersections, which are points of degeneracy between two electronic states in a molecule. Conical intersections play a crucial role in nonadiabatic processes, such as photochemical reactions and radiationless transitions.
The language introduces the notion of a conical point, characterized by a molecular geometry, two degenerate electronic states, and their energy levels. It also defines the Berry phase, which is a geometric phase acquired by a quantum state as it evolves along a closed path.
The structure section states some key principles governing conical intersections:

The Jahn-Teller theorem, which predicts the existence of degenerate states in symmetric molecular configurations
The relationship between the Berry phase and the topological charge of the conical intersection
The Landau-Zener formula for the transition probability between two states near a conical intersection

The proofs section contains two main theorems:

The topological phase effect, which shows that the Berry phase acquired by encircling a conical intersection is always -1, corresponding to a sign change of the electronic wavefunction.
The molecular Aharonov-Bohm effect, which relates the reaction rate of a chemical reaction looping around a conical intersection to the cosine of the Berry phase, analogous to the interference pattern in the quantum mechanical Aharonov-Bohm effect.

The proofs rely on the conical structure of the energy surface near the intersection point, and the adiabatic approximation for the evolution of the electronic states along the reaction path. They showcase the deep connection between the geometry and topology of the potential energy surface and the quantum dynamics of the molecule.
Conical intersections have important consequences for the efficiency and selectivity of photochemical processes, such as vision, photosynthesis, and DNA photodamage. They provide a pathway for ultrafast radiationless decay and a mechanism for coherent control of chemical reactions.

The ConicalIntersection Concept demonstrates the expressive power of the GeometricChemistry framework in capturing complex quantum mechanical phenomena in a concise and intuitive way. It also highlights the interplay between differential geometry, topology, and quantum theory in understanding the behavior of molecules at a fundamental level.
