  HYPOTHESIS MitochondrialCascade {
    let N be a NeuronalNetwork in a brain region affected by AD (e.g. hippocampus, cortex)
    
    for each Neuron in N:
      let M be the Mitochondria
      assume IonGradientImbalance(M) due to age, genetics, or environmental factors
        ; Impaired calcium homeostasis and membrane potential regulation
      hence ElectronTransportChain(M) is disrupted 
        ; Reduced efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation
      hence ATP_Synthase(M) activity is reduced
        ; Decreased ATP production
      hence MetabolicNetwork(Neuron) shifts towards glycolysis and lactate production
        ; Warburg effect and metabolic reprogramming
      hence ROS_Production(M) increases and ROS_Detoxification(M) decreases
        ; Oxidative stress and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
        
    for each Astrocyte connected to N:  
      uptake the excess Lactate released by Neurons
        ; Astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle
      upregulate GlycogenMetabolism to provide energy substrates to Neurons
        ; Metabolic coupling and support
      but overload of Lactate and depletion of Glycogen impairs normal functions
        ; Reduced glutamate uptake, dysregulated calcium signaling, etc.
        
    for each Synapse in N:
      let Pre = PresynapticTerminal and Post = PostsynapticTerminal  
      assume InsufficientATP(Pre) and InsufficientATP(Post) 
        ; Due to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic impairment
      hence NeurotransmitterRelease(Pre) is reduced 
        ; Impaired synaptic vesicle cycling and exocytosis
      hence NeurotransmitterReuptake(Pre) is reduced
        ; Impaired recycling and clearance of neurotransmitters from Cleft
      hence NeurotransmitterReceptorActivation(Post) is altered
        ; Hypo- or hyper-activation depending on the type of receptor 
      hence SignalingCascades(Post) are dysregulated
        ; Aberrant downstream effects on gene expression, cytoskeleton, etc.
      hence SynapticPlasticity(Synapse) is impaired
        ; Reduced capacity for learning and memory
        
    for each Microglia interacting with N:
      detect the ROS, Lactate, and abnormal signaling molecules released by Neurons
        ; Sensing of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
      activate InflammatorySignaling and release Cytokines, Chemokines
        ; Shift towards a pro-inflammatory state (M1 polarization)  
      recruit more Microglia to the site of damage  
        ; Amplification of neuroinflammation
      phagocytose the dysfunctional Synapses and Neurons
        ; Synaptic stripping and neuronal loss  
        
    for each OligodendrocytePrecursorCell (OPC) in the vicinity of N:
      sense the InflammatorySignals released by Microglia
      activate DifferentiationSignaling to transform into mature Oligodendrocytes
      but the newly generated Oligodendrocytes fail to properly myelinate the Axons
        ; Due to the hostile inflammatory environment and impaired metabolic support
      hence SaltatoryConduction(Axon) is disrupted and ActionPotentialPropagation(Neuron) slows down
        ; Reduced efficiency and speed of information processing
        
    as a result:
      the Connectivity and ActivityPatterns of N become progressively disturbed
        ; Loss of synapses, altered neuronal excitability, disrupted network oscillations 
      leading to Neurodegeneration and Cognitive Decline characteristic of AD
        ; Accumulation of damage over years and decades
