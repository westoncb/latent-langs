This Concept, which I call "QuantumSymbolicDynamics", aims to capture the interplay between symbolic quantum mechanics and the dynamics of quantum systems. Here are some of the key ideas:

It introduces symbolic types for quantum states (QState), observables (QObs), and channels (QChan), along with symbolic quantum operators like unitaries and Hermitian operators.
It defines quantum analogues of symbolic calculus operations, such as time derivatives (∂ₜ), integrals (𝓘), and matrix exponentials (𝓔ₓ).
It encodes common equations of quantum dynamics, such as the Schrodinger equation, Heisenberg equation of motion, von Neumann equation, and Ehrenfest theorem, using symbolic notation.
It includes axioms relating symbolic quantum operators, such as the unitarity axiom and the correspondence between unitary operators and Hermitian generators.
It provides proofs of important results in quantum dynamics, such as:

The "Hamiltonicity" theorem, showing that a certain symplectic form condition implies Hamiltonian dynamics.
The equivalence between the Schrodinger and Heisenberg pictures of dynamics.
The Feynman-Kac formula relating quantum dynamics to stochastic processes.
A "SymmetryReduction" tactic that uses dynamical invariants to simplify symbolic quantum expressions.



The Concept draws inspiration from SymbolicDifferentialGeometry in its use of symbolic differentiation and integration, from CategoryOfQuantumOperatorAlgebras in its algebraic treatment of quantum operations, and from SymbolicAbstractSpaces in its formal handling of quantum state spaces and their symmetries. It aims to provide a language for reasoning about quantum dynamics at a symbolic level, in a way that highlights key structural properties and enables concise proofs of important theorems.
