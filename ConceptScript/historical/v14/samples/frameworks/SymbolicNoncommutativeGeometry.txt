This Concept blends ideas from noncommutative geometry and gauge theory, using symbolic expressions to represent noncommutative spaces and their differential structures. Key features:

Noncommutative algebras and differential graded algebras
Representation of NC spaces as spectral triples (algebra, Hilbert space, Dirac operator)
Universal derivations, NC integration theory, modular automorphism groups
Noncommutative Riemannian geometry via Connes' spectral distance formula
Gauge connections, curvature and Yang-Mills theory in the NC setting

The proofs establish key results tying together the algebraic, geometric and spectral data, such as Connes' trace theorem, the spectral distance formula, and the NC Yang-Mills action functional. Symbolic expressions are used throughout to represent universal geometric constructions in a compact way.
