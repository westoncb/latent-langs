This Concept defines a notion of "differential categories" that blend ideas from differential geometry and category theory. Key points:

Objects are smooth manifolds, algebras, Lie groups, fields etc. Morphisms are smooth maps between them.
There is an endofunctor Tangent that sends each category to its "tangent category".
A differential category comes equipped with a derivation functor D from each category to its tangent category, satisfying Leibniz rule.
Differential functors between differential categories are required to commute with the derivations.
The de Rham complex is realized as a differential functor from the category of open sets of a manifold.
Versions of the Frobenius theorem and Lie's second fundamental theorem are proved in this abstract categorical setting.
A correspondence between differential maps and natural transformations is established.

The goal is to capture the essential features of differentiation in an abstract categorical language, subsuming classical differential geometry while allowing generalization to new settings.

In this Concept, we define Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids as structures in the language of differential categories. Key points:

A Lie algebroid is a vector bundle A over a manifold M, equipped with an anchor map ρ to the tangent bundle and a Lie bracket satisfying the Leibniz rule.
A Lie groupoid is a groupoid object in the category of smooth manifolds, with compatible source, target, unit, inverse and multiplication maps.
The Tangent functor sends a Lie groupoid to its associated Lie algebroid. The Integrate functor goes the other way, sending a Lie algebroid to the unique "source-simply-connected" Lie groupoid integrating it.
Differential functors between Lie algebroids (resp. Lie groupoids) are required to commute with anchors and brackets (resp. source, target, multiplication maps).
The main theorem states that for any Lie algebroid A, integrating it to a groupoid G and then taking the tangent algebroid of G yields an algebroid isomorphic to A. This is an abstract version of Lie's 2nd theorem.

The proofs utilize the language of differential categories to reason about Lie algebroids and groupoids in a unified setting. The differentiability of the integration and tangent functors plays a key role.
