This Concept, called "SymbolicDynamicalSystem", combines ideas from symbolic computation, dynamical systems theory, and differential geometry. The key components are:

A language for expressing dynamical systems using symbolic expressions (Sym), which can represent constants, variables, and compositions.
Notions of flows (continuous time evolution), maps (discrete time evolution), and vector fields from dynamical systems theory.
Manifolds as the phase spaces on which dynamical systems evolve, including symplectic manifolds which are the natural setting for Hamiltonian mechanics.
Operations like Lie derivatives, Poisson brackets, symplectic structures from differential geometry, expressed symbolically.
Proofs of key theorems relating symbolic expressions to dynamical and geometric properties, such as integrability conditions for flows, properties of Hamiltonian flows, infinitesimal symmetries and conserved quantities.

The goal is to enable reasoning about dynamical systems and their symmetries/conserved quantities in a symbolic/algebraic way, unifying discrete and continuous, finite and infinite-dimensional dynamics. Potential applications could be in mathematical physics, control theory, and dynamical systems theory.
