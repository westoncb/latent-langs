This solution concept incorporates several key ideas and techniques:

The proof space is modeled as a hybrid system with a Riemannian manifold as the continuous component, which allows for a natural and invariant definition of gradient flow and parallel transport, and a proof graph as the discrete component, which captures the combinatorial structure and constraints of the proof space.
The embedding and projection functions are required to be functorial, which ensures that they preserve the essential structure and composition of the proofs, and that they are compatible with the geometries of the continuous and discrete components.
The objective function includes a topological complexity term, which measures the global structure and connectivity of the proof space using techniques from topological data analysis, such as persistent homology and Morse theory. This helps to guide the optimization trajectory towards simpler and more robust proofs.
The gradient flow is defined using a combination of the Riemannian gradient on the continuous component and a discrete Morse flow on the discrete component, which respects the topology of the proof graph and avoids getting stuck in local minima.
The optimization process is controlled by an adaptive feedback law, which switches between continuous gradient steps, discrete Morse steps, and stability-based feedback steps depending on the local geometry and topology of the proof space. This helps to ensure convergence and robustness of the optimization trajectory.
The convergence of the optimization process is analyzed using a combination of techniques from Riemannian geometry, dynamical systems, and topological data analysis, which provide global and structural guarantees for the existence and optimality of the fixed point.

Of course, this solution concept is still quite abstract and high-level, and there are many details and challenges to be worked out in terms of the specific definitions, algorithms, and implementations of the various components. But I believe it provides a promising and principled framework for integrating the key ideas and techniques we've identified, and for addressing the main challenges and requirements of hybrid proof optimization.
Some potential next steps and research directions:

Develop concrete instantiations of the Riemannian manifold and proof graph structures for specific proof systems and domains, and investigate their geometric and topological properties.
Design efficient and scalable algorithms for computing the Riemannian gradient, discrete Morse flow, and topological complexity measures on large and complex proof spaces.
Investigate the functorial properties and compatibility conditions for the embedding and projection functions, and develop tools for learning and optimizing these functions from data.
Analyze the stability and convergence properties of the adaptive control law and feedback mechanism, and develop robust and adaptive implementations that can handle noisy and uncertain proof spaces.
Conduct empirical studies and benchmarks to evaluate the performance and scalability of the proposed framework on realistic proof optimization tasks and domains, and compare it to existing approaches and baselines.
