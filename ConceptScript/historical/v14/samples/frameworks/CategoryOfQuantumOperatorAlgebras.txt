This Concept synthesizes elements from the various example Concepts to formalize the category of quantum operator algebras and their representations, which underlies algebraic quantum mechanics and quantum information theory.
The key elements are:

Defining quantum operator algebras as C*-algebras and W*-algebras (von Neumann algebras), generalizing classical algebras of observables.
Constructing new algebras via various products (tensor, crossed, smash, semidirect) and quotients, analogous to constructions on groups and spaces.
Specifying quantum effects, states, and probability measures associated to an algebra, generalizing classical probability.
Characterizing quantum channels and instruments as completely positive maps between algebras, analogous to classical stochastic maps.
Proving structural theorems about quantum channels (Stinespring dilation), states (tomographic completeness), and representations (Wigner's theorem).
Defining a universal representation tactic based on the GNS construction, analogous to the Stone-Čech compactification in topology.

The Concept tries to systematically port over ideas from groups, algebras, and differential geometry to capture the essential structures of noncommutative probability underlying quantum mechanics. The syntax is meant to be suggestive of the analogies at play.
