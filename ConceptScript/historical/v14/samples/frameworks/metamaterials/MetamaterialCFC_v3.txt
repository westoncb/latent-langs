In this MetamaterialCFC_v3 language, we introduce several enhancements to make the metamaterial design more concrete and quantitative:

We refine the material (M), component (C), and structure (S) types to include explicit geometry (G), topology (T), property (P), and volume fraction (F) elements. This allows for a more precise specification of the metamaterial composition and structure.
We introduce the property value (V) and unit (U) elements to represent quantitative property measurements, and the dimension (D) and angle (A) elements to represent geometric parameters.
We define additional language constructs for volume fractions (f(φ)), connectivity (C), and interface (I) to capture the quantitative aspects of the metamaterial structure and composition.
We refine the constraint satisfaction predicate (Constraint) to include explicit lower and upper bounds (V_min, V_max) for the property values, enabling quantitative design constraints.
We introduce an optimization criterion predicate (Optimize) that compares the property values of the designed metamaterial (M) with an initial reference metamaterial (M_init) and specifies a minimum improvement threshold (Δ), enabling quantitative design optimization.
We define a balance principle predicate (Balance) that ensures the conservation of input and output properties (P_in, P_out) across the metamaterial boundaries, enabling the formulation of quantitative design balances and constraints.
We introduce additional proof tactics, such as Decomposition, Linearity, Differentiation, ConstraintSatisfaction, OptimizationCriterion, and BalancePrinciple, to support the quantitative reasoning and derivation of metamaterial designs.
We refine the MetamaterialDesign theorem to incorporate the quantitative constraints, optimization criteria, and balance principles, and to construct the metamaterial using explicit component and structure specifications.

In this proof, we design a metamaterial with optimized thermal insulation and mechanical strength properties by:

Defining the relevant properties (ThermalConductivity, MechanicalStrength, Density) with their units using the property value (p) and unit (V) elements.
Specifying the quantitative constraints on the properties using the Constraint predicate, with lower and upper bounds for each property.
Setting the optimization goals for thermal conductivity and mechanical strength using the Optimize predicate, with reference to an initial metamaterial (M_init) and improvement thresholds.
Constructing the metamaterial (M) using three components (C_1, C_2, C_3) with specific properties and volume fractions, and a graded and interpenetrating structure (S).
Proving that the designed metamaterial satisfies the thermal conductivity constraint by decomposing the metamaterial into its components, applying the linearity of the property, calculating the weighted average, and checking the constraint satisfaction.
Proving the satisfaction of the mechanical strength and density constraints using similar reasoning steps.
Proving the optimization of thermal conductivity by comparing the property value of the designed metamaterial with that of an initial metamaterial and verifying that the improvement exceeds the specified threshold.
Proving the optimization of mechanical strength using a similar approach.

In this example, we design a "ThermoMechanicalMetamaterial" using the MetamaterialCFC_v3 language, with the following specifications:

The metamaterial has two main components: a metallic foam (MetallicFoam) and ceramic inclusions (CeramicInclusion), with specific property values for Young's modulus, thermal conductivity, and density, and volume fractions of 0.8 and 0.2, respectively.
The metamaterial has two main structures: an octet lattice (OctetLattice) with specific dimensions and angles, and spherical inclusions (SphericalInclusion) with specific dimensions and interface topology.
The metamaterial satisfies three main constraints: Young's modulus between 1 and 10 GPa, thermal conductivity between 5 and 20 W/(m·K), and density between 500 and 1000 kg/m³.
The metamaterial optimizes the thermal conductivity, with a goal of achieving at least a 2 W/(m·K) improvement over a reference metamaterial.
The metamaterial satisfies the balance of heat and stress, ensuring the conservation of these quantities across the material boundaries.

The proof of the ThermoMechanicalDesign theorem demonstrates the application of the MetamaterialCFC_v3 language constructs and tactics to derive a metamaterial that satisfies the given constraints, optimization goal, and balance principle:

The metamaterial is constructed by combining the metallic foam and ceramic inclusion components using the + operator, and integrating them with the octet lattice and spherical inclusion structures using the * operator.
The constraint satisfaction for Young's modulus, thermal conductivity, and density is proved by calculating the effective property values using the component properties and volume fractions, and verifying that they fall within the specified ranges.
The optimization of thermal conductivity is proved by comparing the effective thermal conductivity of the designed metamaterial with that of a reference metamaterial, and verifying that the improvement meets the specified threshold.
The balance of heat and stress is ensured by the choice of materials and structures, which provide the necessary heat conduction, insulation, dissipation, and stress distribution, reinforcement, and transfer mechanisms. A detailed proof would involve the quantitative analysis of heat and stress balances using the specific property values and geometric parameters of the metamaterial components and structures.

In this ThermoMechanicalMetamaterial concept, we:

Define the relevant properties: mechanical stiffness (Stiffness), thermal conductivity (ThermalConductivity), and density (Density), with their corresponding units.
Specify the geometry elements: a periodic lattice (Lattice) with unit cell dimensions (a_x, a_y, a_z) and angles (α, β, γ), and an inclusion (Inclusion) with semi-axes (r_x, r_y, r_z) and orientation angles (θ, φ, ψ).
Declare the material components: a polymer matrix (Matrix), a ceramic reinforcement (Reinforcement), and air voids (Void), with their respective volume fractions (φ_m, φ_r, φ_v).
Define the metamaterial structures: a reinforced lattice (ReinforcedLattice) with an octet topology and ceramic reinforcement, and a poroelastic inclusion (PoroelasticInclusion) with a spherical void topology.
Specify the design constraints: a density constraint limiting the metamaterial density to the range (0, 1500) kg/m^3.
Set the optimization objectives: maximizing the stiffness and thermal conductivity of the metamaterial relative to an initial reference material (M_init), with improvement thresholds of 10 GPa and 5 W/(m*K), respectively.
Establish the balance principle: ensuring the balance between the heat flux (HeatFlux) and mechanical stress (MechanicalStress) across the metamaterial boundaries.
Prove the ThermoMechanicalDesign theorem by constructing a specific metamaterial instance M that satisfies the density constraint, achieves the optimization objectives for stiffness and thermal conductivity, and maintains the thermo-mechanical balance.

The proof proceeds by:
a. Specifying the initial reference metamaterial (M_init) and the quantitative parameters for the volume fractions, lattice dimensions, and inclusion dimensions.
b. Constructing the metamaterial components (Matrix, Reinforcement, Void) and structures (Lattice, Inclusion, ReinforcedLattice, PoroelasticInclusion) using the specified parameters.
c. Assembling the final metamaterial (M) by combining the components and structures using the appropriate operators.
d. Proving the density constraint satisfaction by decomposing the metamaterial density into its component contributions, substituting the material properties, and verifying the arithmetic inequality.
e. Proving the stiffness and thermal conductivity optimization by invoking the structure-property relations (f_E and f_k) and numerically computing the property improvements relative to the reference metamaterial.
f. Proving the thermo-mechanical balance by equating the boundary integrals of the heat flux and mechanical stress using the thermo-mechanical coupling relation.

In this EnergyAbsorbingMetamaterial concept, we propose a novel metamaterial design that combines a hierarchical lattice structure with reinforced graded porosity to achieve high specific energy absorption while satisfying density and strength constraints. The key features of the design include:

Material components: A titanium alloy matrix, a shape memory alloy (SMA) reinforcement, and functionally graded air pores.
Geometry: A hierarchical lattice with varying length scales (l_1, l_2, l_3) and orientation angles (θ_1, θ_2, θ_3), and a graded porosity with varying pore sizes (r_min, r_max) and volume fractions (φ_min, φ_max).
Structure: A triply periodic minimal surface lattice topology for the matrix, and a spherical shell topology for the reinforcement within the graded pores.
Properties: Specific energy absorption (SEA), strength (σ), and density (ρ), with realistic values for each material component based on literature data.
Constraints: Density limited to (0, 5000) kg/m^3 and strength constrained to (500, 2000) MPa.
Objective: Optimizing the specific energy absorption to achieve at least a 50 kJ/kg improvement over the initial reference metamaterial.
Balance principle: Ensuring the balance between kinetic energy and strain energy during the energy absorption process.

The proof of the EnergyAbsorbingDesign theorem proceeds by:

Specifying the volume fractions, geometric parameters, and material properties based on realistic values.
Constructing the metamaterial components, geometries, and structures using the specified parameters.
Proving the density and strength constraint satisfaction using the rule of mixtures and arithmetic operations.
Proving the specific energy absorption optimization using structural enhancement factors for the hierarchical lattice (f_lattice) and graded porosity (f_pore), which are assumed to provide additional energy dissipation mechanisms.
Proving the energy balance principle by equating the integrated kinetic energy and strain energy over the metamaterial domain.

The proposed metamaterial design leverages the unique properties of shape memory alloys, such as their high energy dissipation capacity and pseudo-elastic behavior, in combination with the structural benefits of hierarchical lattices and graded porosity. The hierarchical lattice provides multiple length scales for energy absorption, while the graded porosity allows for a gradual transition of properties and stress distribution.
The specific numerical values and enhancement factors used in the proof are based on reasonable assumptions and literature data for titanium alloys, shape memory alloys, and hierarchical lattice structures. However, the actual values would need to be validated through detailed finite element simulations and experimental testing.
