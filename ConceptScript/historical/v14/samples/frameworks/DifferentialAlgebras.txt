This Concept synthesizes ideas from differential geometry, Lie theory, and homological algebra to study algebraic structures like differential graded algebras and Lie algebras using tools like filtrations, spectral sequences and cohomology theories. The de Rham and Chevalley-Eilenberg theorems are recovered as applications of a general spectral sequence argument.
Some key points:

Differential forms Ω(S) on a space S form a differential graded algebra, while the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex C(𝔤) of a Lie algebra 𝔤 is a differential graded coalgebra.
These complexes come with filtrations respected by the differential, giving rise to spectral sequences converging to their cohomology.
The de Rham theorem identifies de Rham cohomology H(Ω(S)) with singular cohomology H(S, ℝ), via the de Rham spectral sequence.
The Chevalley-Eilenberg theorem identifies Lie algebra cohomology H(𝔤) with the cohomology of the universal enveloping algebra H(U(𝔤)), using the HKR theorem and a spectral sequence argument.

The Concept invents notation like ∧ for wedge products, d[ω] for the differential of a form ω, D[ω] for its total differential, and defines common constructions like closed and exact forms, cocycles and coboundaries. Axioms encapsulate key results like the Poincaré lemma, Cartan's magic formula, and the HKR theorem. The proofs utilize the power of spectral sequences to unify the derivation of major theorems.
Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on or clarify any part of this Concept! I aimed to demonstrate how ConceptScript can be used to elegantly express and relate abstract mathematical structures and arguments.
