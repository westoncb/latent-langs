In this High Stiffness High Damping Metamaterial concept, we:

Define the multiscale geometry with a cubic lattice of coated spherical inclusions, with tetragonal shape symmetry.
Assign high stiffness and high damping properties to the inclusion and coating phases, relative to the matrix.
Construct graded interphases between the matrix, coating, and inclusion, using an exponential interpolation of properties.
Assemble the multiscale composite with the specified geometry, properties, and processes, including the coupling between the phases.
Verify that the effective properties of the composite satisfy the target high stiffness and high damping criteria, using homogenization.
Verify that the composite satisfies the governing equations of linear elasticity and is stable under small perturbations, using the strain energy criterion.
Verify that the composite is invariant under the specified lattice and shape symmetries, using the transformation and invariance predicates.
Conclude the existence of a material that satisfies all the requirements, using the IsSatisfied predicate and the conjunction of the individual requirements.

The key ideas are:

Using a hierarchical microstructure with high stiffness inclusions and high damping coatings to achieve the target properties.
Introducing graded interphases to smooth the property mismatch and improve the load transfer between the phases.
Exploiting the lattice and shape symmetries to simplify the analysis and ensure the invariance of the material properties.
Verifying the effective properties, governing equations, stability, and symmetries using the predicates and axioms of the MetamaterialLanguage_v4.

In this Auxetic Metamaterial concept, we:

Define a multiscale geometry with a square lattice of cross-shaped unit cells, which have a central void and hinge-like connectors, with 4-fold rotational symmetry.
Assign solid material properties to the cross-shaped frame and void properties to the central hole.
Assemble the multiscale auxetic material with the specified geometry, properties, and processes, including the coupling between the solid and void phases.
Verify that the effective Poisson's ratio of the material is negative and within the target range, using homogenization.
Verify that the material satisfies the governing equations of linear elasticity and is stable under small perturbations, using the strain energy criterion.
Verify that the material is invariant under the specified lattice and rotational symmetries, using the transformation and invariance predicates.
Conclude the existence of a material that satisfies all the requirements, using the IsSatisfied predicate and the conjunction of the individual requirements.

The key ideas are:

Using a cross-shaped unit cell geometry with a central void and hinge-like connectors to enable auxetic behavior through the rotation of the rigid frames.
Exploiting the square lattice and rotational symmetries to ensure the isotropy and invariance of the effective properties.

In this Energy Absorbing Re-entrant Honeycomb concept, we:

Define the unit cell geometry as a re-entrant hexagon with a specific wall length (ℓ), angle (θ), and thickness (t), arranged in a hexagonal lattice with 6-fold rotational symmetry.
Assign high-strength material properties to the cell walls and low-density properties to the bulk material.
Assemble the multiscale energy-absorbing material with the specified geometry, properties, and processes, including the coupling between the wall and bulk domains.
Verify that the effective properties of the material, such as the strength and density, satisfy the target requirements and bounds, using homogenization.
Verify that the material satisfies the governing equations of nonlinear elasticity, is stable under incremental deformations, and achieves a high specific energy absorption, using the strain energy and mass computations.
Verify that the material is invariant under the specified lattice and rotational symmetries, using the transformation and invariance predicates.
Conclude the existence of a material that satisfies all the requirements, using the IsSatisfied predicate and the conjunction of the individual requirements.

The key ideas are:

Using a re-entrant hexagonal unit cell geometry with thin, high-strength walls and a low-density bulk to maximize the specific energy absorption.
Exploiting the nonlinear deformation mechanisms of the re-entrant honeycomb, such as the bending and buckling of the cell walls, to dissipate energy efficiently.
Optimizing the geometric parameters, such as the wall angle and thickness, to achieve the desired strength, density, and energy absorption properties.
Verifying the effective properties, governing equations, stability, and symmetries using the predicates and axioms of the MetamaterialLanguage_v4.
