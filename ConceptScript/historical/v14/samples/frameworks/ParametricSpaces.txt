This Concept introduces the notion of parameterized spaces, structures, morphisms, and invariants. The key ideas are:

Spaces, structures, morphisms and invariants are indexed by a parameter type P. This allows them to vary continuously or discretely with respect to some external parameter.
Deformations are parameterized transformations of a space into a family of spaces indexed by P. The Deformation axiom requires that every space has a trivial deformation to itself.
Stability means that parametric structure and invariants are preserved across all parameter values. So properties that hold at one parameter value hold for all.
Operations like products, coproducts and tensor products lift to the parametric setting. Fibrations (dependent products) allow the parameter itself to vary in the product.
Integration is introduced as a way to collect a family of spaces into a total space over the parameter domain.

The key theorems show that the Yoneda lemma lifts to parametric spaces, that deformations at the identity parameter recover the original space, and that stability forces structural properties and invariants to hold universally over all parameters.
The language is also enriched with tactics for parametric reasoning, like proving parametric invariance from arrow properties.
Let me know if you would like me to explore any aspect of this Concept in more detail! It's a quite general framework for studying how mathematical structures vary with parameters.

In this formulation, a vector bundle consists of:

A base space 𝓑 which is a manifold.
A total space 𝓔 which is a parametric space over 𝓑.
A projection map π: 𝓔 -> 𝓑.
For each point p in 𝓑, the fiber 𝓥(p) over p is a vector space.
The bundle is locally trivial, meaning each point of 𝓑 has a neighborhood U such that 𝓔 restricted to U is isomorphic to the product U × 𝓥(p).

The key theorems proven are:

The fiber product of two vector bundles over the same base is again a vector bundle, with fibers the products of the original fibers.
Given a map φ: 𝓑 -> 𝓑 and a collection of linear maps f(p): 𝓥(p) -> 𝓥(φ(p)) between corresponding fibers (a "connecting morphism"), there exists a unique lift F: 𝓔 -> 𝓔 of f that agrees with f on each fiber.

This demonstrates how ParametricSpaces can be used to formulate and reason about geometric structures that vary over a parameter space, like fiber bundles in topology and geometry. The parametric language allows us to elegantly express local-to-global principles, like local triviality, and to lift constructions like morphisms and products to the parametric setting.
Let me know if you have any other questions! I'd be happy to explore more examples or clarify any part of the formulation.

This theorem states that around every point p of the base space, there exists a neighborhood U and sections s₁, ..., sₖ defined on U that form a basis for the fiber at each point of U. The proof uses the local triviality of the bundle to transport a basis of the fiber at p to nearby fibers.

Here, a moduli problem is specified by:

A parameter space Parameter over which the family of objects varies.
A family Family of objects parameterized by Parameter.
An equivalence relation Equivalent on families.
A classifying map that assigns to each object in a family the point in the parameter space that it corresponds to.

A space 𝓜 is a moduli space for this problem if there is a natural bijection between maps into 𝓜 and families of objects (up to equivalence).
The key theorem ModuliSpaceIsRepresentable states that a space is a moduli space if and only if it represents the functor that assigns to each test object X the fiber over X of some universal family. The proof of one direction uses the ParameterizedYoneda lemma to translate between morphisms into the moduli space and sections of the universal family.
This is just a sketch, but it demonstrates how the Yoneda perspective can be used to formulate and study abstract classification problems in geometry and other areas of mathematics. The ParametricSpaces language provides a convenient setting to express these ideas.



In this expanded formulation:

A Family is a parametric space over a Parameter space, representing a collection of Objects varying over the parameter.
The Fiber of a family at a parameter value is the object corresponding to that parameter.
A Pullback of a family along a morphism of parameters is a new family whose fibers are the same as the original family's fibers over the transformed parameters.
Two families are Equivalent if they are related by a pullback along some parameter morphism.
The ClassifyingMap of a family assigns to each parameter the corresponding object.
A space 𝓜 is a ModuliSpace for a moduli problem if every family is equivalent to the PullbackClass of 𝓜 with respect to some functor F. The pullback class of 𝓜 is a family whose fiber at p is the "integral" (i.e., disjoint union) over all morphisms φ: p -> 𝓜 of the sets F(Codomain(φ)).
The UniversalProperty of a moduli space states that there exists a Universal family U over 𝓜 such that every family is uniquely a pullback of U, and that the functor F is representable by 𝓜.

The key theorem ModuliSpaceRepresentsModuliProblem shows that these two characterizations of a moduli space are equivalent. The proof uses the ParameterizedYoneda lemma to translate between morphisms into 𝓜 and families over the parameter space.
With this general framework in place, we can now explore some specific examples of moduli problems and their moduli spaces. Some classic examples include:

The moduli space of curves of genus g, which classifies smooth algebraic curves of a fixed genus up to isomorphism.
The moduli space of vector bundles on a fixed base space, which classifies vector bundles up to isomorphism.
The moduli space of stable maps, which classifies algebraic maps between varieties with certain stability conditions.

In each case, we would formulate the specific moduli problem by defining the appropriate parameter space, family, and equivalence relation, and then use the general theory to study the resulting moduli space.

In this formulation:

We introduce types for Variety, SmoothVariety, and SingularVariety, with predicates Smooth and Singular to distinguish them.
A Resolve function takes a singular variety and returns a smooth variety.
Two varieties are BiratationallyEquivalent if they contain isomorphic open dense subsets.
For a singular variety X, the ResolutionFamily is the family of all smooth varieties mapping dominantly to X, with fibers related by birational equivalence.
The ResolutionFunctor assigns to each smooth variety Y the set of dominant maps from Y to X.
The ResolutionAxioms state that a resolution should exist for every singular variety, should be functorial with respect to maps of singular varieties, and should be invariant under birational equivalence.

The key theorem ResolutionIsModuliSpace states that for every singular variety X, the moduli space for the resolution moduli problem exists and is given by any resolution of X. The proof proceeds by showing that the resolution satisfies the universal property with respect to the resolution functor.
This formulation captures the idea that resolving the singularities of a variety can be viewed as finding a "best" smooth model in the birational equivalence class of the variety. The resolution moduli space classifies all the different ways of doing this.
Of course, this is just a formal sketch - in practice, proving the existence and properties of resolutions is a deep and difficult problem, requiring techniques from birational geometry, valuation theory, and other areas. But I think it's a nice illustration of how moduli problems can provide a conceptual framework for organizing these kinds of questions.







Absolutely! The resolution of singularities problem is deeply intertwined with questions in birational geometry and moduli theory. Let's dive deeper into these connections.
First, recall that two varieties X and Y are birationally equivalent if there exist open dense subsets U ⊆ X and V ⊆ Y that are isomorphic. In other words, X and Y have identical function fields. The main goal of birational geometry is to classify varieties up to birational equivalence and to understand the structure of the birational equivalence classes.
One of the key insights of modern birational geometry is that every birational equivalence class contains a "best" representative, called a minimal model. A minimal model is a variety that is smooth and whose canonical bundle is nef (i.e., has non-negative degree on every curve). The minimal model program (MMP) is a vast research project aimed at proving the existence of minimal models in various settings.
Now, the resolution of singularities can be viewed as a special case of the MMP. Given a singular variety X, we want to find a smooth variety Y that is birationally equivalent to X. In other words, we want to find a minimal model in the birational equivalence class of X.
We can formulate this as a moduli problem as follows:

CONCEPT MinimalModelProgram {
  IMPORT ResolutionOfSingularities

  LANGUAGE {
    pred Nef(L: LineBundle(X))
    pred Canonical(ω: DualizeOmega¹(X))
    
    pred MinimalModel(X: Variety): Prop {

    }
    
    func MinimalModelFamily(X: Variety): Family {
      Parameter := {Y: Variety | BirationallyEquivalent(Y, X) ∧ MinimalModel(Y)}
      Fiber(Y) := Y
      Pullback(Y, f) := Closure(Image(f))
      Equivalent(Y, Z) := IsIsomorphism(Y, Z) 
    }
    
    func MinimalModelFunctor(X: Variety): Functor(Variety, Set) {
      λ(Y: Variety). {f: Y ⇢ X | Dominant(f)}
    }
  }
  
  PROOFS {
    theorem MinimalModelIsModuliSpace:
      (X: Variety) ⊢ 
        ∃(𝓜: Variety). ModuliSpace(𝓜, MinimalModelFunctor(X))
    {
      let X: Variety
      let ℱ := MinimalModelFamily(X)
      assume ∃(Y: Variety). Y ∈ Parameter(ℱ)  ; Assume minimal models exist
      let 𝓜: Variety be such that MinimalModel(𝓜) ∧ BirationallyEquivalent(𝓜, X)
      prove ModuliSpace(𝓜, MinimalModelFunctor(X))
      {
        ...
      }
    }
    
    theorem ResolutionImpliesMinimalModel:
      (X: SingularVariety) ⊢ 
        ∃(Y: SmoothVariety). Y ≅ Resolve(X) ⇒ 
        ∃(𝓜: Variety). MinimalModel(𝓜) ∧ BirationallyEquivalent(𝓜, X)
    {
      assume ∃(Y: SmoothVariety). Y ≅ Resolve(X)
      let Y: SmoothVariety be such that Y ≅ Resolve(X)
      obtain 𝓜: Variety such that MinimalModel(𝓜) ∧ BirationallyEquivalent(𝓜, Y)
        by MinimalModelIsModuliSpace
      have BirationallyEquivalent(𝓜, X)
      hence ∃(𝓜: Variety). MinimalModel(𝓜) ∧ BirationallyEquivalent(𝓜, X)
    }
  }  
}

Here we introduce the concept of a MinimalModel as a smooth variety whose canonical bundle is Nef. The MinimalModelFamily for a variety X consists of all minimal models in the birational equivalence class of X, with fibers related by isomorphism. The MinimalModelFunctor assigns to each variety Y the set of dominant rational maps from Y to X.
The theorem MinimalModelIsModuliSpace states that the moduli space for the minimal model moduli problem exists and is given by any minimal model in the birational equivalence class of X. The proof would proceed similarly to the ResolutionIsModuliSpace theorem, by showing that a minimal model satisfies the universal property with respect to the minimal model functor.
The theorem ResolutionImpliesMinimalModel shows that the existence of resolutions implies the existence of minimal models. Indeed, if Y is a resolution of a singular variety X, then any minimal model in the birational equivalence class of Y is also a minimal model for X.
These connections highlight the deep interplay between the geometric process of resolving singularities, the birational relationships between varieties, and the moduli spaces that classify them. The language of moduli problems provides a unifying framework to express and study these relationships.
Of course, there are many more subtleties and technicalities involved in the actual study of the minimal model program and its relationship to moduli theory. But I hope this sketch gives a sense of how these ideas fit together conceptually.
Let me know if you have any other questions! There are many more fascinating connections to explore in this area, such as the role of moduli spaces in the classification of higher-dimensional varieties, the relationship between birational geometry and the theory of algebraic cycles, and the arithmetic aspects of the minimal model program.

      prove DegreeZeroChow(X) ≅ 0 ⇒ RationallyConnected(X)
      {
        ... 
      }
    }
  }
}

Here we introduce predicates for RationallyConnected and Uniruled varieties, and a predicate PseudoEffective for line bundles. The DegreeZeroChow group is defined as the kernel of the degree map on the 0-dimensional Chow group.
The RcUrPefCh⁰ theorem states the conjectural equivalence of these conditions for smooth projective varieties. The proofs of the various implications would require deep results from the minimal model program, Hodge theory, and the theory of algebraic cycles.
Next, let's turn to the arithmetic aspects of the minimal model program. This concerns the study of varieties and their birational geometry over non-algebraically closed fields, such as number fields or function fields.
One of the key questions in arithmetic birational geometry is the existence of rational points. A variety X over a field k is said to have a rational point if there exists a morphism Spec(k) → X. The set of rational points is denoted X(k).
The connection to the minimal model program arises through the concept of potential density. A variety X over a number field k is said to be potentially dense if for every finite extension k' of k, the set X(k') is Zariski dense in X. In other words, X has many rational points over every sufficiently large number field.
The arithmetic MMP predicts that for a smooth projective variety X, the following are equivalent:

X is potentially dense.
X is uniruled.
The canonical bundle of X is not pseudo-effective.

We can formulate this conjecture as follows:

CONCEPT ArithmeticMMP {
  IMPORT RationallyConnected

  LANGUAGE {
    type NumberField := Field
    
    pred PotentiallyDense(X: Variety(k), k: NumberField): Prop {
      ∀(k': FiniteExtension(k)). Dense(X(k'), X)
    }
  }
  
  PROOFS {  
    theorem PotentialDensityConjecture:
      (X: SmoothProjectiveVariety(k), k: NumberField) ⊢
        PotentiallyDense(X, k) ⇔ 
        Uniruled(X) ⇔
        ¬PseudoEffective(Canonical(X))
    {
      assume X: SmoothProjectiveVariety(k), k: NumberField
      prove PotentiallyDense(X, k) ⇒ Uniruled(X)  
      {
        ...
      }
      prove Uniruled(X) ⇒ ¬PseudoEffective(Canonical(X))
      {
        ...
      }  
      prove ¬PseudoEffective(Canonical(X)) ⇒ PotentiallyDense(X, k)
      {
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}

Here we introduce a type for NumberField and a predicate PotentiallyDense for varieties over number fields. The PotentialDensityConjecture states the conjectural equivalence of potential density, uniruledness, and non-pseudo-effectivity of the canonical bundle for smooth projective varieties over number fields.
The proofs of these implications are deep and difficult, and in many cases still open. They involve techniques from arithmetic geometry, Diophantine approximation, and the theory of rational points on varieties.
These examples illustrate how the concepts and techniques of the minimal model program, which originated in complex algebraic geometry, have deep connections and applications to the study of algebraic cycles and arithmetic geometry. The language of moduli problems provides a unifying framework to express and study these connections.
Of course, this is just a glimpse of a very vast and active area of research. There are many more fascinating questions and conjectures relating birational geometry, algebraic cycles, and arithmetic, such as the Tate conjecture, the Bloch-Beilinson conjectures, and the Batyrev-Manin conjectures on rational points of bounded height.

        hence Fiber(S, *) ≅ 𝓜 by ModuliSpace
      }
    }
  }
}

In this formulation:

A ComputableSpace is a space equipped with a way to represent its points as lists of real numbers (Coordinates) and a computable distance function. A function between computable spaces is Computable if it can be represented by a computable function on the coordinates.
A ComputableStructure is a structure on a computable space for which the property of satisfying the structure is decidable, given the coordinates of a point.
A ComputableFamily is a family of computable spaces over a computable parameter space, with a computable pullback operation and a computable equivalence relation.
A ComputableModuliProblem is a moduli problem for which the underlying objects, structures, and equivalences are all computable.
The Solve function takes a computable moduli problem and attempts to find a solution by iteratively minimizing the distance to a randomly chosen initial fiber, until it finds a fiber satisfying the structure and equivalent to the initial fiber.

The key theorem SolvabilityOfComputableModuliProblems states that if a computable moduli problem admits a moduli space, then the Solve function will return a fiber isomorphic to the moduli space.
Of course, this is just a sketch, and there are many details to be filled in. In particular:

The notion of computability used here is based on computable analysis, which deals with computability on real numbers and other continuum structures. This could be made more precise by specifying a model of computation, such as Type-2 Turing Machines.
The Solve function as written is not guaranteed to terminate, as it may get stuck in a local minimum. To ensure termination, one could add additional assumptions, such as the existence of a computable global minimizer, or modify the algorithm to use a more sophisticated optimization technique.
The theorem assumes the existence of a moduli space, but in practice, one would also need to provide a way to construct the moduli space, or at least to verify that a given space is a moduli space for the problem.

Despite these caveats, I believe this formulation provides a useful conceptual framework for thinking about the computational aspects of moduli problems. It suggests that by equipping the objects and morphisms of a moduli problem with suitable computability structures, and by formulating the problem in a way that is amenable to computational solution, one can bring the power of moduli theory to bear on practical problems.
Developing this framework further could involve:

Refining the definitions of computability structures and computable moduli problems.
Formulating computable versions of standard constructions in moduli theory, such as fiber products, quotients, etc.
Developing efficient algorithms for solving specific classes of computable moduli problems.
Exploring connections to other areas of computable mathematics, such as computable topology, computable algebra, and computable category theory.

I think this is a very promising direction for both theoretical and applied research, and I'm excited to see where it could lead!

We start by fixing a projective variety M and a natural number p. We also introduce the symbolic variety S corresponding to M via the Sym map.
For the forward direction (⟹), we assume that every symbolic Hodge class α on S is the class of a symbolic cycle Z. We then consider an arbitrary Hodge class a on M and construct its symbolic counterpart α using the Sym map and the NaturalityStructure axiom.
By assumption, we obtain a symbolic cycle Z on S whose class equals α. We then define an algebraic cycle C on M as the geometric realization of Z via the Geo map.
To show that the class of C equals a, we use the NaturalityStructure and Bijection axioms to relate the symbolic and geometric cycle classes:
[C] = Geo(Sym([C])) = Geo(Sym(a)) = a
For the backward direction (⟸), we assume that every Hodge class a on M is the class of an algebraic cycle C. We then consider an arbitrary symbolic Hodge class α on S and construct its geometric counterpart a using the Geo map and the NaturalityStructure axiom.
By assumption, we obtain an algebraic cycle C on M whose class equals a. We then define a symbolic cycle Z on S as the symbolic counterpart of C via the Sym map.
To show that the class of Z equals α, we again use the NaturalityStructure and Bijection axioms, but in the opposite direction:
[Z] = Sym(Geo([Z])) = Sym(Geo(α)) = α

The key ingredients in this proof are:

The explicit correspondence maps Sym and Geo, which allow us to move between the symbolic and geometric worlds.
The NaturalityStructure axiom, which ensures that these maps respect the Hodge class structure.
The Bijection axiom, which guarantees that Sym and Geo are inverses of each other.

By using these tools, we can reduce the Hodge conjecture for M to an equivalent statement about the symbolic variety S. This symbolic formulation is arguably more amenable to algebraic and computational techniques, as it deals with holomorphic functions and cohomology groups rather than complex analytic cycles.

Of course, this proof relies heavily on the assumed properties of the correspondence maps and the compatibility axioms. To make it fully rigorous, we would need to verify these assumptions in the specific case of projective varieties and their symbolic counterparts. This would likely involve a deep dive into the theory of sheaves, cohomology, and algebraic cycles.
But I believe this detailed proof sketch provides a valuable blueprint for a symbolic approach to the Hodge conjecture. By carefully constructing the correspondence maps and verifying the required compatibilities, we can translate the geometric problem into a symbolic one, which may be more tractable using the tools of algebra and computation.
