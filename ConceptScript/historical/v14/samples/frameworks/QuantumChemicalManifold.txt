    theorem VariationalTheorem(Ĥ: Hamiltonian, |ψ⟩: Ket, E₀: ℝ):

      assume E₀ = Min(E[|ϕ⟩]) for |ϕ⟩ ∈ ChemicalManifold
      
      have δE[|ψ⟩] / δ⟨ψ| = 0   ; |ψ⟩ is a minimum of E
      hence ⟨δψ|(Ĥ|ψ⟩ - E₀|ψ⟩) = 0  ∀ |δψ⟩  ; 1st order variation
      hence Ĥ|ψ⟩ = E₀|ψ⟩  ; Since ⟨δψ| arbitrary
    }

    theorem HohenbergKohn(ρ: Fun(ChemicalManifold, ℝ), Ĥ: Hamiltonian):
      determines(ρ, Ĥ)
    { 
      assume ρ = ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ for some |ψ⟩
      
      {{ 
        suppose ∃ Ĥ', V̂' ≠ V̂ . Ĥ'|ψ'⟩ = E'|ψ'⟩ ∧ ⟨ψ'|ψ'⟩ = ρ

        E = ⟨ψ|Ĥ|ψ⟩ < ⟨ψ'|Ĥ|ψ'⟩ = ⟨ψ'|Ĥ' + (V̂ - V̂')|ψ'⟩ < E' + ∫ ρ(V̂ - V̂')

        hence E + E' < E + E', contradiction
      }}
        
      hence ρ uniquely determines V̂ (up to a constant)
      and since V̂ + T̂ = Ĥ, ρ uniquely determines Ĥ

This Concept establishes a foundational language and framework for quantum chemistry by:

Defining a "chemical manifold" where each point corresponds to a quantum state |ψ⟩. Observables and the Hamiltonian map from this manifold to real values.
Stating the core postulates of quantum mechanics in this framework - state space, observables, dynamics, and composite systems.
Specifying the key constituents - electrons, nuclei, Coulombic and exchange fields.
Proving foundational theorems:

The Variational Theorem relates energy minimization to ground states
The Hohenberg-Kohn Theorem establishes that the electron density uniquely determines the Hamiltonian
The Density Functional Theorem defines the energy as a functional of the density
The Van Vleck Theorem expresses the determinant in terms of exterior powers of the Hamiltonian



The proofs leverage the notations and axioms to reason about quantum states, operators and their relationships on the chemical manifold. Techniques from differential geometry like exterior algebra are used to compactly express key results.
So in summary, this Concept provides a mathematically rigorous yet abstract language to reason about the foundations of quantum chemistry, unifying concepts from quantum mechanics, density functional theory and differential geometry.
