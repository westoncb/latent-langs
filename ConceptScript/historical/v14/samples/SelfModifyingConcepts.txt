      have ∀ S ∈ C.Structure. D ⊢ I(S)
      proof:

This SelfModifyingConcepts concept explores the meta-properties of concepts written in ConceptScript. Key ideas:

Metacircularity: A valid concept can express itself within its own language. This is shown via a substitution operation that expands the concept's types/axioms.
Extensibility: Given any valid concept, it's always possible to transform it into a new valid concept that the original could not express. This is shown by adding a new unprovable axiom.
Interpretation: For any two valid concepts, there always exists a meaningful interpretation from one to the other, in the sense of mapping the first concept's structure to theorems provable in the second. A trivial example mapping is constructed.

The proofs make use of custom notation like C[X/Y] for concept substitution, and tactics like Structurality (preservation of validity under transformation).
