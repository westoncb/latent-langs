    {
      The vertex part [(v ↦ ∑_{u ∈ N(v)} (x(v) - x(u)) · eWe1(u, v))] resembles the Hodge Laplacian on 0-forms.
      The differences [(x(v) - x(u))] approximate the exterior derivative on vertex fields.
      The edge part [(u, v) ↦ eWe2(u, v) · (x(u) - x(v))] resembles the Hodge Laplacian on 1-forms.
      The differences [(x(u) - x(v))] approximate the coboundary operator on edge fields.
      The learnable weights [eWe1] and [eWe2] provide flexibility to adapt to the graph structure.
      Thus, LearnableSheafLaplacians approximate Sheaf Laplacians while being computationally efficient.

The key ideas in this PracticalSheafNets Concept are:

Focus on vertex and edge fields (0-forms and 1-forms) for simplicity and efficiency.
Define a sheaf convolutional layer (sheafConv) that aggregates information from the local neighborhood of each vertex, weighted by learnable parameters.
Introduce an edge pooling layer (edgePooling) to update edge features based on the incident vertex features.
Use residual connections (sheafRes) to facilitate training of deep sheaf neural networks.
Propose learnable Sheaf Laplacian-like operators (LearnableSheafLaplacians) that approximate the action of Hodge Laplacians on vertex and edge fields, while being computationally efficient.

The proofs sketch the reasoning behind the locality of sheaf convolution and the approximation properties of the learnable Sheaf Laplacians.

This new concept, SheafEquivariantGraphNets, builds upon the ideas of DiscreteCalcGraphNeuralNets by introducing sheaf-theoretic constructions and equivariance properties:

It defines sheaf morphisms, such as the exterior derivative and Hodge star, to capture the rich structure of cochain fields on the graph.
The message-passing and convolution operations are made equivariant to graph automorphisms, ensuring that the learned features are invariant to symmetries in the graph.
Hodge Laplacians are introduced to enable learning on differential forms of all degrees, generalizing the notion of graph convolution to higher-order structures.

The potential applications of this concept include:

Geometric deep learning on manifolds and simplicial complexes
Learning invariant and equivariant features for 3D shape analysis
Modeling physical systems with gauge symmetries, such as electromagnetism or fluid dynamics
Analyzing higher-order network flows and dynamics in complex systems
