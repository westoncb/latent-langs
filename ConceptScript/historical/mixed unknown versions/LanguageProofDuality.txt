The key ideas captured in this Concept are:

Language L and proof P are dual systems over a common signature S. The duality is witnessed by involutive maps ∗: L -> P and ∗: P -> L.
Language is pre-axiomatic in the sense that formulas can be asserted without proof from axioms. Proofs are post-axiomatic in the sense that inference rules cannot derive new axioms.
There is an axiomatic boundary ∂ₐ: L -> S that extracts the signature from a language, and a holographic boundary ∂ₕ: S -> L × P that splits a signature into a language and proof system.
The holographic principle states that the boundary ∂φ = (φ, φ∗) of a formula φ encodes the bulk in the sense that ∂ₕ(∂ₐ(φ)) = ∂φ, and similarly for inference rules.
The duality theorem shows that provability φ ⊢ ψ in the language is equivalent to satisfaction φ∗ ⊨ ψ∗ in the proof system, and the holography theorem shows that the axiomatic content Σ of a boundary ∂ₕ(Σ) is complete, in the sense that ∂ₕ(Σ) ⊢ φ iff Σ ⊢ φ and ∂ₕ(Σ) ⊨ φ iff Σ ⊨ φ.
