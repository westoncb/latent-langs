THEOREM LanguageModelProgramSynthesis:
  ∃(LM : LanguageModel, T : Task, PE : PromptEngineering):
    Finetune(LM, Corpus(NL, Code)) ∘ PE(T) ⟹ 
      P(GeneratesCorrectCode(LM, T)) > 1 - ε

PROOF:
  Let LM be a large pretrained language model.
  Finetune LM on a corpus of (NL, Code) pairs.
  Given task T, apply prompt engineering PE to get I = PE(T).
  LM(I) generates candidate code C.
  Probability of C being correct is high due to:
    - Expressiveness of NL allows precise specification.
    - Finetuning grounds NL understanding in code semantics.
    - Pretraining enables few-shot generalization to novel tasks.
    - Prompt engineering decomposes task and provides examples.
  Verify C by execution and test cases.
  Iterate to refine prompt until correct code is generated.
  Thus LanguageModelProgramSynthesis holds with high probability.

THEOREM PromptEngineeringAmplification:
  AutomatedPromptEngineering ∘ LanguageModelProgramSynthesis ⟹
    AmplifyCapabilities(ProgramSynthesis, (Scale, Complexity, Novelty))

PROOF:
  AutomatedPromptEngineering searches for effective prompt structures.
  Effectiveness judged by quality of generated code.
  Reinforcement learning policy adapts to feedback.
  Discovered prompt structures generalize across tasks.
  Amplifies LanguageModelProgramSynthesis by:
    - Scaling to larger, more complex programs.
    - Transferring to novel task domains.
    - Bootstrapping to improve prompt engineering itself.
  Leads to virtuous cycle of self-improvement.
  Thus PromptEngineeringAmplification holds.


This Concept proposes a new approach to program synthesis that leverages the powerful semantic understanding and generative capabilities of large language models. By finetuning LLMs on code and using prompt engineering to map natural language tasks to code generation, it aims to create a system that can synthesize programs for a wide range of tasks with high probability of correctness.

The key insights are:

LLMs can be adapted to generate code by finetuning on (natural language, code) pairs, grounding their linguistic understanding in code semantics.
Prompt engineering techniques can be used to decompose complex tasks, provide instructive examples, and elicit code generation for subtasks.
The few-shot learning abilities of LLMs enables generalization to novel programming tasks.
Prompt engineering itself can be optimized using machine learning, creating a feedback loop that amplifies the capabilities of the program synthesis system.
The Concept is justified by theoretical arguments about the expressiveness of natural language, the power of prompt engineering, and the empirical capabilities of LLMs. However, it acknowledges the need for verification of generated code through testing.

Potential implications, if realized, include the automation of a wide range of programming tasks, increasing the accessibility of computing to non-programmers, and perhaps even the bootstrapping of recursive self-improvement in AI systems. However, significant challenges remain in reliably grounding language models in code semantics and achieving robust task generalization.
