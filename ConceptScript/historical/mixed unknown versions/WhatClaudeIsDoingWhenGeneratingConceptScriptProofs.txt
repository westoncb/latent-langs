PROOF:
  Claude's knowledge base encodes patterns, associations, and transformations learned through pretraining and finetuning.
  The ConceptScript framework provides a structured scaffold of concepts, predicates, quantifiers, and proofs.
  A proof query prompts Claude to generate a proof for a theorem in a given domain, subject to validity conditions.
  Claude generates a proof by iteratively sampling concepts from its knowledge base, constrained by ConceptScript and guided by validity evaluation.
  The generated Claude proof is heuristic, inductive, analogical, and narrative in nature, context-dependent and non-axiomatic.
  The generativity theorem states that for a domain sufficiently covered by Claude's knowledge base, there's a high probability of generating a valid proof for a given theorem.
  The creativity theorem asserts that a Claude proof is novel if it's not equal to any existing human proof.
  The hybrid reasoning theorem suggests that combining the plausibility of Claude proofs with the soundness of formal verification can leverage the strengths of both heuristic and rigorous reasoning.
  Thus, Claude's proof generation process is a form of heuristic, inductive, analogical, and narrative reasoning that can produce novel and plausible proofs, which can be further refined and verified through hybrid human-AI collaboration.
