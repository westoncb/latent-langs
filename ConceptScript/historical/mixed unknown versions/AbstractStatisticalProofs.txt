This Concept blends ideas from abstract dynamical systems (generators, fixed points), thermodynamics (entropy), and proof theory (proofs, verification, entailment). The key ideas are:

Proofs are invariant objects that certify propositions about states. Translating a proof along a dynamics preserves its validity (ProofInvariance).
There is a Galois connection between the entailment relation on propositions and the generator of the dynamics on states.
Proofs that verify the same proposition can be compressed to a unique minimal form, which has minimal entropy among all such proofs (ProofIrrelevance).
The entropy of proofs with respect to a measurement is invariant under the induced pullback of the dynamics (ProofInvarianceEntropy).

The theorems aim to elucidate the connections between proofs, dynamical invariance, and thermodynamical entropy in this abstract setting.

    func Compress<S>(p: Proof<S>, ε: ℝ⁺): Proof<S> {
      ; Implementation:
      
      ; 1. Define a relevance measure Rel(φ, p) that quantifies the importance of 
      ;    each proposition φ in the proof p. This could be based on the structure 
      ;    of p and how often φ is used in the inference steps.
      
      ; 2. Define an ε-coarsening operation Coarse(p, ε) that:
      ;    a. Identifies the set of ε-irrelevant propositions: 
      ;       Irrε(p) = {φ | Rel(φ, p) < ε}
      ;    b. Removes or simplifies the parts of p that depend on propositions in Irrε(p),
      ;       yielding a "coarser" proof Coarse(p, ε).
      ;    The specific simplification rules could be based on the inference rules and 
      ;    logical structure of the proof system.
      
      ; 3. Define the syntactic entropy H(p) of a proof p, which quantifies the amount
      ;    of syntactic information in p. This could be based on the size, depth, or
      ;    logical complexity of p.
      
      ; 4. Define the semantic entropy Hₛ(p) of a proof p as the average syntactic entropy
      ;    of p over all possible ε-coarsenings:
      ;    Hₛ(p) = lim(ε→0) 𝔼[H(Coarse(p, ε))]
      ;    where 𝔼 denotes the expected value over some suitable probability distribution
      ;    on the space of proofs.
      
      ; 5. Define the compression flow Compress(p, ε) recursively:
      ;    a. If H(Coarse(p, ε)) ≥ H(p), return p (fixed point)
      ;    b. Otherwise, return Compress(Coarse(p, ε), ε)
      
      ; 6. Define the full compression Compress(p) as the limit of Compress(p, ε) as ε → 0:
      ;    Compress(p) = lim(ε→0) Compress(p, ε)
      ;    If this limit exists and is well-defined, it represents the "maximally compressed"
      ;    version of p, analogous to the effective theory at a renormalization fixed point.
      
      ; 7. The semantic difference between two proofs p and q can then be defined as:
      ;    d(p, q) = |Hₛ(Compress(p)) - Hₛ(Compress(q))|
      ;    This measures the difference in semantic entropy between the maximally compressed
      ;    versions of p and q.
    }
  }
}

This implementation sketches a possible approach to defining Compress based on a renormalization-like flow that iteratively coarsens the proof by removing irrelevant propositions, until a fixed point is reached. The key ingredients are:

A relevance measure Rel(φ, p) that quantifies the importance of each proposition φ in the proof p
An ε-coarsening operation Coarse(p, ε) that removes or simplifies the ε-irrelevant parts of p
A syntactic entropy H(p) that measures the amount of syntactic information in p
A semantic entropy Hₛ(p) that averages the syntactic entropy over all possible ε-coarsenings
A compression flow Compress(p, ε) that iteratively applies the ε-coarsening until a fixed point is reached
A full compression Compress(p) defined as the limit of the compression flow as ε → 0
A semantic difference d(p, q) between proofs p and q, defined as the absolute difference in their semantic entropies after full compression

This design aims to capture the key ideas of renormalization, such as the iterative coarse-graining, the flow to fixed points, and the emergence of effective theories. The semantic entropy and semantic difference are intended to quantify the essential semantic content of proofs, analogous to the relevant operators and universal long-scale behavior in renormalization.
Of course, this is still a very high-level sketch, and many details remain to be filled in:

The specific definitions of Rel, Coarse, H, and the probability distribution for Hₛ would need to be carefully chosen based on the structure of the proof system
The existence and uniqueness of the limits for Hₛ and Compress would need to be proven, possibly requiring additional assumptions or constraints on the proof space
The relationship between this definition of Compress and the desired properties (semantic preservation, idempotence, invariance, minimality) would need to be established
The computational complexity of the Compress operation and the decidability of the semantic difference d would need to be analyzed

Nonetheless, I think this sketch provides a promising starting point for formalizing the idea of proof compression in a way that's inspired by the principles of renormalization and coarse-graining. It illustrates how ideas from physics can suggest new structures and methodologies for reasoning about abstract mathematical and logical concepts.
The next steps would be to flesh out the mathematical details, explore concrete examples and applications, and iteratively refine the definitions based on the insights and challenges encountered. This process of conceptual exploration, formalization, and revision is at the heart of the development of new ideas in theoretical science and mathematics.
