The key ideas behind this classical algorithm are:

We maintain an amplitude distribution over the vertices of the graph, initialized to a uniform distribution.
In each iteration, we apply an amplitude boosting step that doubles the amplitude of the marked vertices, followed by a diffusion step that mixes the amplitudes of all vertices.
After a certain number of iterations (proportional to the square root of the number of vertices), we sample a vertex according to its amplitude and return it as the output.

The amplitude boosting step is analogous to the selective phase inversion in Grover's algorithm, while the diffusion step is analogous to the inversion about the mean. By alternating these two steps, we gradually amplify the amplitude of the marked vertices while suppressing the amplitude of the unmarked ones, leading to a high probability of sampling a marked vertex after a sufficient number of iterations.
We prove a theorem (GroverSpeedup) that relates the runtime of this classical algorithm to the runtime of the quantum Grover's algorithm, showing that it achieves a quadratic speedup over naive classical search methods. The proof relies on the analysis of Grover's algorithm and the runtime of the classical subroutines used in our algorithm.
Some potential benefits and implications of this classical algorithm:

It provides a novel way to search for marked vertices in a graph, inspired by quantum principles but implemented using classical techniques.
It achieves a quadratic speedup over naive search methods, which can be significant for large graphs or real-time applications.
It demonstrates the potential of using amplitude-based techniques and mixing processes in classical algorithms, which may have applications beyond search problems.
It shows how our framework can be used to formalize and analyze quantum-inspired classical algorithms, by providing a language and structure for expressing quantum concepts and reasoning about their classical analogues.

Of course, this is just a sketch and there are many details and optimizations to be worked out. But I believe it illustrates the potential of our approach to inspire new and efficient classical algorithms by leveraging insights from quantum computing.
Some possible directions to explore further:

Implementing and testing the algorithm on real-world graphs and benchmarking its performance against other classical search methods.
Analyzing the algorithm's sensitivity to errors and noise, and developing robust versions that can handle imperfect or incomplete information.
Extending the algorithm to other graph problems, such as finding shortest paths, clusters, or communities, by adapting the amplitude boosting and diffusion steps.
Investigating the relationship between this algorithm and other quantum-inspired classical algorithms, such as simulated annealing, variational optimization, and quantum-inspired neural networks.
