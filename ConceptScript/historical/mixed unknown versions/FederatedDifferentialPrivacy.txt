LANGUAGE:
  PRIMITIVES:
    - Data sources S_i, Local models w_i, Global model W
    - Privacy parameters ε, δ, Privacy budget B
    - Noise mechanisms Lap(·), Gauss(·)
    
  SYNTAX:  
    - Functional notation for model updates and aggregation
    - Probabilistic notation for privacy guarantees
    
  SEMANTICS:
    - Data sources are distributed entities with private data
    - Local models are trained on each data source's private data
    - The global model is an aggregation of the local models
    - Privacy parameters quantify the privacy loss and protection
    
  AXIOMS:
    - Local data remains private and is not shared directly
    - The global model learns from aggregated local updates
    - Differential privacy limits the influence of individual data points
    
  INFERENCE RULES:
    - Composition theorem for privacy budgets: B_final = ∑ B_i
    - Postprocessing invariance: f(M(D)) is ε-DP if M(D) is ε-DP
    - Group privacy: M(D) is kε-DP for groups of size k
    
  EXTENSIONS:
    - Import secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption
    - Define model compression, secure aggregation, adaptive clipping

GIVEN:
  - A set of data sources S_i, each with private data D_i
  - A learning task T and a model architecture M
  - Privacy parameters ε, δ, and a privacy budget B
  
DEFINE:  
  - Each data source S_i trains a local model w_i on its private data D_i
  - The global model W is computed by aggregating the local models w_i
  - Differential privacy is achieved by adding noise Lap(·) or Gauss(·) to the model updates
  
ASSERT:
  - The global model W learns useful patterns from the distributed data
  - The privacy of each data source S_i is protected by ε-differential privacy
  - The approach is scalable, fault-tolerant, and communication-efficient

THEOREM Federated_DP_Convergence:
  - The federated differentially private learning algorithm converges to a stable and accurate global model W, while preserving ε-differential privacy for each data source S_i

PROOF:
  - Each data source S_i computes a local model update Δw_i based on its private data D_i
  - The local updates Δw_i are clipped to a maximum L2 norm C to limit sensitivity
  - Gaussian noise Gauss(C·σ) is added to the clipped updates to achieve (ε,δ)-DP
  - The noisy updates are securely aggregated to obtain the global model update ΔW
  - The global model W is updated using ΔW, and the process repeats for T rounds
  - By the composition theorem, the total privacy budget is B = T·ε
  - As T increases, the signal-to-noise ratio improves, and the global model converges
  - The convergence rate depends on the noise scale σ, the clipping threshold C, and the number of data sources N
  - Advanced techniques like adaptive clipping and secure aggregation can further improve convergence and security
  - Therefore, the federated differentially private learning algorithm converges to an accurate global model while preserving the privacy of each data source

THEOREM Federated_DP_Accuracy:
  - The accuracy of the federated differentially private model W approaches the accuracy of a non-private centralized model as the number of data sources N increases, for a fixed privacy budget B

PROOF:  
  - Consider a non-private centralized model W_c trained on the combined data D = ⋃ D_i
  - The accuracy of W_c depends on the size and quality of the centralized dataset D
  - In the federated setting, each data source S_i contributes a noisy local update Δw_i
  - As the number of data sources N increases, the aggregated noise in ΔW decreases
  - Specifically, the variance of the aggregated noise scales as 1/N for Gaussian noise
  - Thus, for a fixed privacy budget B = T·ε, increasing N allows for smaller noise scale σ
  - With smaller noise, the federated model W converges closer to the centralized model W_c
  - Advanced techniques like model compression and transfer learning can further boost accuracy
  - In the limit of large N, the federated model W approaches the accuracy of the centralized model W_c
  - Therefore, the accuracy of the federated differentially private model improves with the number of data sources, approaching the centralized accuracy for a fixed privacy budget


This Concept expresses a novel approach to privacy-preserving federated learning using differential privacy. The key ideas are:

Data remains locally private and is not shared directly
Local models are trained on each data source and aggregated into a global model
Differential privacy is achieved by adding noise to the model updates
The approach is scalable, fault-tolerant, and converges to an accurate solution
Accuracy improves with more data sources for a fixed privacy budget
The Concept includes formal definitions, assertions, theorems, and proofs to justify the approach and its properties. It also suggests extensions and advanced techniques to further improve the method.

The ConceptScript language allows expressing these ideas in a precise, compact, and modular way, by defining the primitives, syntax, semantics, axioms, and inference rules of the federated differential privacy framework. The language facilitates formal reasoning and enables extending and building upon the core concepts.
