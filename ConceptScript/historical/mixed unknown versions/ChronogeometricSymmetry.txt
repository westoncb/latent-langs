This Concept formalizes the notion of "ChronogeometricSymmetry", which refers to the symmetries of spacetime that preserve its causal structure, metric geometry, parallel transport, and curvature. The key ideas are:

Spacetime is represented as a set of events, with worldlines, spacelike, timelike, and lightlike subsets capturing its causal structure.
Symmetries are represented as transformations of spacetime, with specific types for translations, rotations, reflections, and inversions.
Algebraic structures such as groups and crystals are used to classify and generate spacetime symmetries.
Geometric properties such as metric, connection, and curvature are used to characterize the intrinsic geometry of spacetime.
Chronogeometric symmetries are defined as those that preserve the causal, metric, parallelism, and curvature structures of spacetime.
Classification predicates are used to identify spacetimes with specific properties, such as those with a Lorentzian metric, flat connection, or vanishing curvature.
The CrystallographicPoincareTheorem proves that any crystallographic group of spacetime symmetries must be a subgroup of the Poincaré group.
The FlatLorentzianSymmetryTheorem proves that any flat Lorentzian spacetime admits boost and rotation symmetries that preserve its causal, metric, parallelism, and curvature structures.
