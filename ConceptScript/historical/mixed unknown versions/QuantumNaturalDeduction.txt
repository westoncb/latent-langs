CONCEPT QuantumNaturalDeduction:

EXTEND QuantumLogic:
  Proposition := Formula(Qubits, Gates, Measurements)
  Inference := Transformation(Propositions, Justification)
EXTEND QuantumComputation:
  State := Superposition(Qubits, Amplitudes)
  Entailment := Transformation(States)

DEFINE Judgment := Relation(Propositions, Entailment)
DEFINE Derivation := Sequence(Judgments, Inferences)

ASSERT Notation:
  "H ⊢ Q" := Judgment(Hypotheses(H), Entailment(Q))
  "H, P ⊢ Q" := Judgment(Hypotheses(H) + Proposition(P), Entailment(Q))
  "⊢ P" := Judgment(Hypotheses(∅), Entailment(P))

ASSERT InferenceRules:
  Axiom: (H ⊢ P) ∈ H ⟹ H ⊢ P
  Weakening: H ⊢ Q ⟹ H, P ⊢ Q
  Contraction: H, P, P ⊢ Q ⟹ H, P ⊢ Q  
  Cut: H ⊢ P ∧ H, P ⊢ Q ⟹ H ⊢ Q
  Tensor: H₁ ⊢ P ∧ H₂ ⊢ Q ⟹ H₁, H₂ ⊢ P ⊗ Q
  Par: H, P ⊢ R ∧ H, Q ⊢ R ⟹ H, P ⅋ Q ⊢ R
  Implication: H, P ⊢ Q ⟹ H ⊢ P ⊸ Q
  Negation: H, P ⊢ ⊥ ⟹ H ⊢ ¬P
  Measurement: ⊢ M(P ⊗ Q) ≡ M(P) ⊗ M(Q)
  Entanglement: ⊢ ¬(P ⊗ Q) ≡ ¬P ⅋ ¬Q

DEFINITION CoherenceConditions:
  Duality: ¬¬P ≡ P
  Associativity: (P ⊗ Q) ⊗ R ≡ P ⊗ (Q ⊗ R)
  Commutativity: P ⊗ Q ≡ Q ⊗ P
  Identity: P ⊗ 1 ≡ P
  Distributivity: P ⊗ (Q ⅋ R) ≡ (P ⊗ Q) ⅋ (P ⊗ R)

THEOREM Soundness:
  ∀ Derivation(H ⊢ Q):
    Coherent(H) ⟹ Entails(H, Q)

PROOF:
  By induction on the structure of the derivation.
  Base case: Axiom rule preserves soundness by definition.  
  Inductive cases:
    - Each inference rule is sound with respect to the semantics of the connectives.
    - Coherence conditions ensure consistency of the entailment relation.
  Thus, any derivation starting from a coherent set of hypotheses produces a sound entailment.

THEOREM Completeness:
  ∀ Propositions(P, Q):
    Entails(P, Q) ⟹ ∃ Derivation(P ⊢ Q)

PROOF:
  By the decomposition of entailment into primitive inference steps.
  Each entailment can be decomposed into a sequence of inference rule applications.
  The inference rules are complete with respect to the semantics of the connectives.
  Thus, any valid entailment can be represented as a derivation in the proof system.
