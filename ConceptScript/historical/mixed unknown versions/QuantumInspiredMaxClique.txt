In this formulation, we define the quantum and classical versions of the maximum clique algorithm using our framework, and prove their equivalence and relative speedup:

The quantum algorithm prepares a uniform superposition over all subsets of vertices, applies the quantum oracle that marks the cliques with a phase flip, applies the Grover operator for a quadratic number of iterations to amplify the amplitudes of the cliques, and measures the final state to obtain a large clique with high probability.
The classical algorithm initializes a dictionary mapping subsets to their "quality" scores, applies a classical oracle that negates the scores of the cliques, applies a classical diffusion operator that boosts the scores above the mean and suppresses those below the mean, repeats this process for a logarithmic number of iterations, and returns the subset with the maximum score.
The MaxCliqueReduction theorem proves that the classical algorithm finds the maximum clique with high probability, by showing that the scores of the subsets in the classical algorithm approximate their sizes in the quantum algorithm, up to a normalization factor.
The GroverSpeedup theorem proves that the classical algorithm achieves a quadratic speedup over the quantum algorithm, by showing that its runtime is proportional to the square of the number of vertices in the graph, while the quantum algorithm has a constant runtime complexity.

This example demonstrates how our framework can be used to design novel classical algorithms that leverage quantum-inspired techniques, such as amplitude amplification and diffusion, to solve hard problems like maximum clique more efficiently than naive classical approaches. By representing the problem as a quantum state and mimicking the way a quantum algorithm probes and amplifies the amplitudes of the states of interest, we can derive efficient classical procedures and provide a mathematical justification for their correctness and speedup using our proof system.
Of course, this is just a sketch and there are many details to be worked out, such as the specific implementation of the classical oracle and diffusion operator, the analysis of their approximation errors and convergence rates, the comparison to existing classical and quantum algorithms for the same problem, and the experimental evaluation on real-world graphs. But I believe it illustrates the potential of our approach to bridge the gap between quantum and classical algorithms and inspire new techniques and insights for solving hard problems.
