This Concept explores ideas from abstract algebraic geometry, including schemes, sheaves, homological algebra, and derived categories. Some key elements:

It defines basic types for schemes (affine, projective, noetherian, varieties), sheaves (coherent, quasi-coherent, locally free), homomorphisms, and derived categories.
The structure section states important dualities (Serre duality), equivalences (Bondal-Orlov, Keller), and characteristic classes (Chern, Todd).
The proofs section contains several major theorems:

The Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem relating the Euler characteristic to Chern characters.
The Beilinson-Ginzburg-Schechtman (BGS) resolution relating exceptional collections to derived categories.
Beilinson's resolution of the diagonal, reconstructing an object from line bundles.
A criterion for when a Fourier-Mukai functor is fully faithful in terms of skyscraper sheaves.



The Concept attempts to capture the interplay between geometry (schemes), algebra (sheaves and homological algebra), and category theory (derived categories and functors) that is characteristic of modern algebraic geometry. The notation and inference rules enable compact symbolic expressions of deep mathematical ideas.
