This InferentialDynamics Concept explores the interplay between dynamical systems, formal proof systems, and entropy. Some key ideas:

Proofs are structured as a formal language L that can be interpreted into the state space S of a dynamical system.
The entropy H[s] of a state s acts as a measure of the "information content" of that state.
Proofs induce a partial order on states, where p ⊩ q means the proof p entails q. Entailment corresponds to entropy increase (ProofEntropy).
There is a Galois connection between the proof-to-state interpretation ⟦-⟧ and the state-to-proof prover, analogous to the Galois connection between models and theories in logic.
The dynamics on states can be lifted to a "proof search" dynamics on the space of proofs. Converging to a fixed point of the proof dynamics corresponds to finding a proof of the target theorem (DynamicalProofConvergence).
The information content H[⟦l⟧] of an interpreted formula l is the infimum of the entropies of all the proofs of l (Entropy-Inference Duality). This is analogous to defining the Kolmogorov complexity of a string as the length of its shortest program.

The ProofIrrelevance theorem shows that entailment induces an equivalence relation on proofs, allowing us to treat them as unique up to equivalence. The CanonicalRepresentation axiom postulates that every object has a canonical description in the language L, as interpreted by the system S.
