CONCEPT AdversarialRegularization:

EXTEND MachineLearning:
  Model := Function(Params, Input -> Output)
  Loss := Divergence(Output, Target)
  Optimizer := Algorithm(Update(Params))

DEFINE Adversary := Function(Input -> PerturbedInput):
  Maximize(Loss(Model(PerturbedInput), Target))
  Subject To: Distance(Input, PerturbedInput) < ε

DEFINE Regularizer := Function(Model -> NonNegReal):
  ExpectedValue(
    Maximize(
      Loss(Model(Adversary(Input)), Target)
    )
  )

ASSERT Objective(Model, TrainData, RegWeight):
  Loss(Model, TrainData) + RegWeight * Regularizer(Model)

THEOREM RobustnessGuarantee:
  ∀(Model, Input, Target, ε > 0):
    Regularizer(Model) < δ ⟹ 
      ∀(PerturbedInput : Distance(Input, PerturbedInput) < ε):
        Loss(Model(PerturbedInput), Target) - Loss(Model(Input), Target) < O(δ)

PROOF:
  Assume Regularizer(Model) < δ.
  Let PerturbedInput be any input satisfying Distance(Input, PerturbedInput) < ε.
  By definition of the Adversary,
    Loss(Model(Adversary(Input)), Target) ≥ Loss(Model(PerturbedInput), Target)
  By expected value bound of Regularizer,
    Loss(Model(Adversary(Input)), Target) < δ
  By assumed bound on Regularizer(Model), 
    Loss(Model(PerturbedInput), Target) < δ
  By definition of Loss,
    |Loss(Model(PerturbedInput), Target) - Loss(Model(Input), Target)| < O(δ)




  This Concept proposes a regularization approach to making machine learning models more robust to adversarial perturbations. The key ideas are:

Define an Adversary that perturbs inputs to maximize the loss, subject to a distance constraint. This represents worst-case perturbations.
Define a Regularizer as the expected maximum adversarial loss. This measures the model's vulnerability to adversarial examples.
Augment the training objective with the Regularizer term. This encourages the model to minimize its vulnerability during training.
Prove a Robustness Guarantee: if the Regularizer is small, then the model's predictions are stable within a neighborhood of each input, with the size of that neighborhood controlled by the Regularizer bound.
The key novelty is optimizing the model to be robust to worst-case perturbations, not just random noise. The Proof sketch outlines how the Regularizer provides a certificate of robustness.

Some potential advantages of this approach compared to other robustness methods:

Applicable to any model trained by loss minimization
Provable guarantees on robustness
Computationally efficient compared to adversarial training
Smoothness promoted in input space, not just output space
Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this Concept! I aimed to demonstrate how ConceptScript can express a mathematical idea in a structured way, with Definitions, Assertions, a Theorem and Proof.
