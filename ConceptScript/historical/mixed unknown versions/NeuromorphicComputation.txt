This Concept formalizes the idea of "Neuromorphic Computation" by combining elements from neuroscience, machine learning, dynamical systems, fractal geometry, topology, sheaf theory, and variational calculus. The key aspects are:

Neurons are modeled as leaky integrate-and-fire units with synaptic delays and stochastic Poisson firing.
Synapses are modeled as weighted connections between neurons with Hebbian learning rules such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity.
Networks are modeled as directed acyclic graphs with fractal architecture and topological embedding.
Network dynamics are modeled as a sheaf of neural activities over the network manifold.
Learning is modeled as gradient descent on an energy functional defined by the network Lagrangian.
The Universal Approximation Theorem is proved by constructing a feedforward network that approximates any continuous function to arbitrary accuracy using gradient descent learning.

The formalization leverages several advanced concepts from mathematics and physics, such as fractals, manifolds, sheaves, stochastic processes, variational principles, and convergence theorems. It also uses the expressive features of ConceptScript, such as type constructors, function definitions, axioms, theorems, and proof tactics.
