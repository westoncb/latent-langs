This Concept defines an abstract framework for reasoning systems, incorporating elements from logic, type theory, proof theory, and abstract interpretation. It provides a language for expressing logical statements, inference rules for deriving theorems, and a semantics for interpreting statements in models.
Key features include:

Representing a reasoning system as a 4-tuple (L, I, T, P) of language, inference rules, theorems, and proofs
Defining abstraction (α), refinement (ρ), and interpretation (ι) functors between reasoning systems
Providing proof term constructors based on natural deduction
Defining sequent calculus judgments and inference rules
Asserting soundness and completeness of the proof system wrt the semantics
Showing abstraction and refinement form a Galois connection
Proving consistency via the soundness theorem
Proving the cut-elimination metatheorem for the sequent calculus

The framework enables analyzing properties of proofs and reasoning systems and relating different systems via abstraction/refinement. It provides a foundation for formalizing complex logical theories and studying their metatheory.
