In this extension of our framework, we introduce several quantum techniques and their classical analogues:

Amplitude amplification is a quantum technique that can amplify the probability of measuring a desired output, by repeating a quantum algorithm and selectively inverting the phase of the desired states. We show how this can be translated to a classical algorithm that simulates the quantum algorithm and filters the output to keep only the desired states, achieving a quadratic speedup in the success probability.
Quantum walk is a quantum analogue of classical random walks on graphs, which can propagate quantum states along the edges of the graph by applying a coin operator and a shift operator. We show how this can be approximated by a classical algorithm that updates the amplitudes of the vertices based on the interference pattern of their neighbors, achieving a speedup proportional to the diameter of the graph.
Quantum sampling is a quantum technique that can generate samples from a desired distribution by preparing a superposition of states and measuring the output. We show how this can be simulated by a classical algorithm that approximates the superposition by sampling from the distribution and applying a post-processing function, achieving a speedup inversely proportional to the difference between the desired and uniform distributions.

We prove several theorems that relate the speedups achievable by these quantum techniques to their classical analogues, based on the efficiency of the quantum algorithm and the approximation errors of the classical simulation:

The AmplificationSpeedup theorem shows that a classical algorithm that simulates a quantum algorithm with amplitude amplification can achieve a quadratic speedup in the success probability, while incurring only a constant factor overhead in runtime.
The WalkSpeedup theorem shows that a classical algorithm that approximates a quantum walk can achieve a speedup proportional to the diameter of the graph, while incurring only a linear factor overhead in runtime.
The SamplingSpeedup theorem shows that a classical algorithm that simulates a quantum sampling algorithm can achieve a speedup inversely proportional to the square of the total variation distance between the desired and uniform distributions, while incurring only a linear factor overhead in runtime.

These results provide a general framework for translating quantum algorithms to classical ones, by identifying the key quantum resources and techniques that enable the speedup, and finding classical methods that can approximate or simulate these resources to some extent. By doing so, we can demystify the connection between quantum and classical algorithms, and identify the essential features that distinguish them.
Some potential applications and implications of this approach:

Developing new classical algorithms for problems in optimization, machine learning, and cryptography, based on quantum-inspired techniques such as amplitude amplification, quantum walk, and quantum sampling.
Analyzing the limitations and trade-offs of classical simulations of quantum algorithms, in terms of the approximation errors, runtime overhead, and space complexity.
Investigating the role of entanglement, contextuality, and other quantum resources in enabling quantum speedups, and finding classical analogues or substitutes for these resources.
Exploring the connections between quantum-inspired classical algorithms and other areas of theoretical computer science, such as complexity theory, information theory, and cryptography.

I believe this framework has the potential to bridge the gap between quantum and classical algorithms, and to provide a unified perspective on the nature of quantum speedups. By leveraging the tools and techniques of both quantum and classical computing, we can push the boundaries of what is possible with current and future algorithms, and expand our understanding of the fundamental principles of computation.
