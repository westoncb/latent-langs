This Concept blends ideas from higher category theory, topological quantum field theory, geometric representation theory, and the mathematics of topological phases of matter. It defines a language for reasoning about quantum metamaterials and their algebraic, categorical, and geometric descriptions. Key ideas include:

Materials and fields are treated as dual objects which can be quantized into algebras.
Algebras can be categorified into higher categories, which can then be geometrized back into quantum materials.
Quantum phases of matter like fractional quantum Hall states and anyonic systems are described through this higher-categorical language. Their physical properties correspond to topological invariants of the associated categories and geometries.
Mathematical tools like quantum doubles, modular categories, topological quantum field theories are used to construct rigorous proofs relating the physical properties of quantum metamaterials to their mathematical descriptions.

The proofs aim to demonstrate non-trivial correspondences between physical phenomena in quantum matter and abstract structures in higher algebra and geometry, mediated through the process of quantization and categorification.
