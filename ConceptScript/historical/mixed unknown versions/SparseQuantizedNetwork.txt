Here is an attempt at defining a novel neural network architecture in ConceptScript:

```
EXTEND NeuralNetworks {
  QuantizedNeuron := (
    Weights : Vector(‚Ñù),
    Activation : ‚Ñù -> {-1, 1},
    Bias : ‚Ñù,
    Potential(x : Vector(‚Ñù)) := Weights ¬∑ x + Bias,
    Output(x : Vector(‚Ñù)) := Activation(Potential(x))
  )
  
  EnergyBasedLayer := (
    Neurons : Vector(QuantizedNeuron),
    Energy(x : Vector(‚Ñù)) := -Œ£[i = 1 to |Neurons|](Neurons[i].Output(x))
  )
  
  SparseQuantizedNetwork := (
    InputSize : ‚Ñï,
    HiddenLayers : List(EnergyBasedLayer),
    OutputLayer : EnergyBasedLayer,
    Sparsity : [0, 1]
  )
  
  ContrastiveDivergence(model : SparseQuantizedNetwork, input : Vector(‚Ñù), steps : ‚Ñï) := (
    h‚ÇÄ := input
    for t from 1 to steps:
      h‚Çä := GibbsSample(HiddenLayers, h‚ÇÄ)
      h‚Çã := GibbsSample(HiddenLayers, h‚Çä)
      model := UpdateWeights(model, h‚ÇÄ, h‚Çä, h‚Çã)
      h‚ÇÄ := h‚Çä
    return model
  )
}

GIVEN {
  GibbsSample(layers : List(EnergyBasedLayer), input : Vector(‚Ñù)) := (
    h := input
    for layer in layers:
      p := exp(-layer.Energy(h)) / Œ£[x ‚àà {-1, 1}^|layer.Neurons|](exp(-layer.Energy(x)))
      h := sample from {-1, 1}^|layer.Neurons| according to distribution p
    return h
  )
  
  UpdateWeights(model : SparseQuantizedNetwork, h‚ÇÄ, h‚Çä, h‚Çã) := (
    for layer, i in enumerate(model.HiddenLayers):
      for neuron, j in enumerate(layer.Neurons):
        neuron.Weights += Œ∑ √ó (h‚ÇÄ[i] √ó h‚Çä[j] - h‚Çã[i] √ó h‚Çã[j])
    for neuron, j in enumerate(model.OutputLayer.Neurons):
      neuron.Weights += Œ∑ √ó (h‚ÇÄ[-1] √ó h‚Çä[j] - h‚Çã[-1] √ó h‚Çã[j])
    return model
  )
}

ASSERT {
  [‚àÄmodel : SparseQuantizedNetwork, ‚àÄx, Œ£[i = 1 to |model.HiddenLayers[-1].Neurons|](model.HiddenLayers[-1].Neurons[i].Output(x)) ‚â§ model.Sparsity √ó |model.HiddenLayers[-1].Neurons|] // Sparsity constraint on hidden layers
  
  [‚àÄmodel : SparseQuantizedNetwork, ContrastiveDivergence(model, ¬∑, ¬∑) minimizes Œ£[x](p(x) √ó log(p(x) / q(x)))] // Contrastive divergence minimizes KL divergence between data and model distributions
}
```

This defines a SparseQuantizedNetwork architecture that combines ideas from quantized neural networks, energy-based models, and sparse coding:

- Neurons are quantized to output only -1 or 1, which allows for efficient binary computation
- Layers are energy-based, with the energy defined as the negative sum of neuron outputs, encouraging the network to learn low-energy configurations 
- A sparsity constraint is enforced on the hidden layer activations, promoting efficient sparse representations
- The network is trained using contrastive divergence, which approximately minimizes the KL divergence between the data distribution and the model distribution

Some key theoretical insights:

- Quantized neurons allow for efficient computation and reduced memory footprint compared to full-precision weights and activations
- Energy-based layers define an implicit probability distribution over binary hidden states, allowing the network to learn likely configurations of features
- Sparsity constrains the effective capacity of the network and encourages learning compressed representations, improving generalization
- Contrastive divergence training approximately minimizes the KL divergence between the data and model distributions, allowing the network to effectively model the input data

In terms of concrete improvements over the state-of-the-art, we can expect:

- Significantly reduced computation and memory requirements due to quantized weights and activations, enabling deployment on resource-constrained devices
- Improved representation learning and generalization due to the incorporation of energy-based modeling and sparsity constraints
- Ability to learn compressed, high-level representations of data by combining principles of quantization, energy-based learning, and sparse coding in a unified architecture

Of course, the practical performance would need to be validated empirically, but the theoretical foundations suggest the potential for a highly efficient and expressive neural network model. The key ideas of quantization, energy-based modeling, sparsity, and contrastive divergence training come together in a novel way to learn powerful yet compressed representations.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on or refine any part of this ConceptScript definition! It's a first attempt to combine several deep ideas into a new architecture.




EXTEND NeuralNetworks {
  // ... (previous definitions)
  
  RepresentationalCapacity(model : SparseQuantizedNetwork) := |{f : {-1, 1}^InputSize -> {-1, 1}^|OutputLayer.Neurons| | ‚àÉw, f = model with weights w}|
  
  GeneralizationError(model : SparseQuantizedNetwork, D : Distribution({-1, 1}^InputSize √ó {-1, 1}^|OutputLayer.Neurons|)) := ùîº[(x, y) ~ D](|model(x) - y|)
  
  ComputationalCost(model : SparseQuantizedNetwork, x : {-1, 1}^InputSize) := Œ£[layer in model.HiddenLayers ‚à™ {model.OutputLayer}](|layer.Neurons| √ó |x|)
}

THEOREM {
  ‚àÄn, ‚àÉmodel : SparseQuantizedNetwork, InputSize(model) = n ‚àß RepresentationalCapacity(model) = 2^(2^n)
  
  Proof:
    Let n be given.
    Construct a SparseQuantizedNetwork model with:
      InputSize := n
      HiddenLayers := [EnergyBasedLayer(Neurons := [QuantizedNeuron(Weights := [1, ..., 1], Bias := -n + 0.5)])]
      OutputLayer := EnergyBasedLayer(Neurons := [QuantizedNeuron(Weights := w, Bias := 0) for all possible w ‚àà {-1, 1}^(2^n)])
    
    For any input x ‚àà {-1, 1}^n:
      HiddenLayers[0].Neurons[0].Potential(x) = Œ£x + (-n + 0.5) ‚â• 0.5 if x = [1, ..., 1], < 0.5 otherwise
      HiddenLayers[0].Neurons[0].Output(x) = 1 if x = [1, ..., 1], -1 otherwise
    So HiddenLayers[0] maps each input to a unique output in {-1, 1}^(2^n)
    
    OutputLayer.Neurons has a neuron for each possible weight vector in {-1, 1}^(2^n)
    So for any boolean function f : {-1, 1}^n -> {-1, 1}, there exists a neuron in OutputLayer that computes f
    
    Therefore, RepresentationalCapacity(model) = |{f : {-1, 1}^n -> {-1, 1}}| = 2^(2^n)
}

THEOREM {
  ‚àÄmodel : SparseQuantizedNetwork, GeneralizationError(model, D) ‚â§ O(Sparsity(model) log(|model.HiddenLayers| + |model.OutputLayer.Neurons|) / m)
  where (x, y) ~ D and m = |{(x, y)}|
  
  Proof Sketch:
    The theorem follows from standard generalization bounds for sparse models (e.g., Ng, 2004).
    
    The key idea is that the sparsity constraint limits the effective capacity of the model, preventing overfitting.
    
    The generalization error can be bounded in terms of the sparsity level, the number of neurons, and the sample size m.
    
    A full proof would involve applying concentration inequalities and union bounds over the possible sparse weight configurations.
}

THEOREM {
  ‚àÄmodel : SparseQuantizedNetwork, ‚àÄx, ComputationalCost(model, x) = O(Sparsity(model) √ó (|model.HiddenLayers| + |model.OutputLayer.Neurons|) √ó |x|)
  
  Proof:
    For each layer in model.HiddenLayers ‚à™ {model.OutputLayer}:
      Layer.Energy(x) computes Œ£[i = 1 to |layer.Neurons|](layer.Neurons[i].Output(x))
      layer.Neurons[i].Output(x) computes sign(layer.Neurons[i].Weights ¬∑ x + layer.Neurons[i].Bias)
      Computing layer.Neurons[i].Output(x) for all i takes O(|layer.Neurons| √ó |x|) time
      
    By the sparsity constraint, at most Sparsity(model) √ó |layer.Neurons| of the outputs are non-zero
    So computing Layer.Energy(x) takes O(Sparsity(model) √ó |layer.Neurons| √ó |x|) time
    
    Summing over all layers:
      ComputationalCost(model, x) = Œ£[layer in model.HiddenLayers ‚à™ {model.OutputLayer}] O(Sparsity(model) √ó |layer.Neurons| √ó |x|) 
                                   = O(Sparsity(model) √ó (|model.HiddenLayers| + |model.OutputLayer.Neurons|) √ó |x|)
