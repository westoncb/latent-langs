This Concept proposes using engineered metamaterials to implement neural network weights and activations through subwavelength optical structures. It proves that such metamaterial networks are theoretically capable of approximating arbitrary functions, similar to conventional neural networks. However, they have O(1) space and time complexity due to the inherent parallelism and passivity of optical wave propagation through the metamaterial structure. The main energy cost is in encoding and decoding the optical inputs and outputs.

The key ideas are: 1) Complex-valued neural networks are universal function approximators. 2) Metamaterial layers can implement arbitrary complex matrix multiplication through precise subwavelength patterning of refractive index and anisotropy to control phase and amplitude of transmitted waves. 3) A feedforward cascade of such metamaterial layers can therefore act as an efficiently-computable universal function approximator.

Some open challenges would be developing efficient optical encoding/decoding schemes, engineering broadband and low-loss metamaterials, and scaling to large multi-layer networks. Potential advantages include extreme inference speed and energy efficiency compared to digital electronics.
