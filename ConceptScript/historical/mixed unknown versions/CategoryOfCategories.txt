This Concept showcases several features of ConceptScript:

The use of higher-order types and functions to define categories, functors, and natural transformations in a concise and abstract way.
The use of mathematical notation to express composition, whiskering, and component operations.
The formalization of key axioms of category theory, such as identity, associativity, and naturality, using equational reasoning.
The use of a structured proof to show that the category of categories is itself a category, by verifying the categorical axioms using the defined operations and notations.
