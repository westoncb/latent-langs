The DissonanceReduction theorem captures the core idea of Festinger's theory: when an individual holds two contradictory cognitions, it creates a state of dissonance that motivates them to reduce the inconsistency through avoidance, rationalization, or attitude change.
The DissonanceInduction lemma describes how dissonance can arise from inconsistencies between behaviors, attitudes, and values.
The ForcedCompliance proof illustrates a specific case of dissonance induction, where an individual is compelled to comply with a norm that contradicts their attitudes and values.
