This formalization captures several key aspects of black hole physics:

It declares the basic parameters of a black hole (mass M, angular momentum J, charge Q) and the relevant geometrical structures (metric, horizon, ergosphere, singularities).
It defines the Kerr-Newman metric, which is the most general stationary black hole solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory. It also defines the expressions for the event horizon, ergosphere, Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and other thermodynamic quantities.
It states the fundamental equations of general relativity (Einstein field equations, geodesic equation, Raychaudhuri equation) and the laws of black hole mechanics as axioms.
It formalizes the Penrose process (energy extraction from a rotating black hole) and the Hawking and Unruh effects (particle creation by black holes and accelerated observers) using the language of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.
It proves the no-hair theorem, which states that a stationary black hole is uniquely characterized by its mass, angular momentum, and charge. The proof proceeds by showing that any additional fields (electromagnetic, scalar, spinor, higher spin) are either trivial or determined by the black hole parameters.
It proves the existence of Hawking radiation for a large, slowly rotating, weakly charged black hole. The proof constructs the ingoing and outgoing vacuum states, calculates the expectation value of the number operator in the outgoing state, and shows that it corresponds to a thermal distribution at the Hawking temperature. It also derives the total luminosity of the radiation using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

The formalization leverages several advanced concepts from general relativity, quantum field theory, and differential geometry, such as Killing vector fields, Lie derivatives, spinors, and Hilbert spaces. It also uses the language features of ConceptScript, such as type declarations, function definitions, axioms, theorems, and proofs with intermediate calculations.
