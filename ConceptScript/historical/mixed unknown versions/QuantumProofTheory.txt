This Concept blends quantum mechanics with proof theory, using the correspondence between logical provability and quantum probability as a guiding principle. Some key ideas:

Propositions form a Boolean algebra, mirroring the structure of a Hilbert space.
Proofs are represented as trees of sequents, analogous to the tensor product structure of entangled states.
Logical inference rules like Modus Ponens are reformulated in terms of quantum measurements and state transitions.
Soundness and completeness are proved using techniques from both logic (maximally consistent sets, valuations) and quantum mechanics (density operators, expected values).
Logical theorems like Deduction and Double Negation Elimination are derived by exploiting the quantum semantics.
Entanglement between propositions is characterized logically and shown to imply strong dependencies between their provability.

The goal is a unified framework where logical and quantum uncertainty can be reasoned about compositionally, and where insights from one domain can inspire new proof techniques in the other.

This Concept explores the connections between quantum computation (BQP complexity class, quantum circuits, Grover's search) and mathematical proofs (polynomial-size proofs, unique-SAT problems). Some key ideas:

Quantum circuits are modeled as sequences of unitary gates acting on Hilbert space states.
Computational problems are formulated as measuring a certain proposition on a state prepared from a given set of propositions.
The BQP complexity class is defined in terms of efficient quantum circuits that decide problems with bounded error.
The theorem Quantum2Sat establishes an equivalence between polynomial-size provability (Γ ⊩ φ) and quantum feasibility ((Prepare(Γ), Measure(φ)) ∈ BQP).
As an application, Grover's search algorithm is formalized and shown to efficiently solve unique-SAT instances, by reducing them to the quantum feasibility of the corresponding proposition.

The goal is to showcase the expressive power of the framework, by capturing nontrivial quantum algorithms and complexity-theoretic arguments in a concise and mathematically rigorous way, while highlighting the central role of logic and proof theory in grounding the concepts.

Here, we formalized Shor's algorithm and its correctness proof within the QuantumProofComputation framework:

The algorithm is expressed as a sequence of quantum gates (order-finding oracle, QFT) and measurements, using the language of modular arithmetic and Fourier sampling.
The correctness argument is broken down into a series of local deductions about the quantum state after each step, using properties of periodic functions, continued fractions, etc.
Efficiency of the algorithm is established by bounding the circuit size and the number of repetitions needed for a high probability of success.

We then prove a theorem relating the factoring problem to the provability of a certain 2-SAT formula encoding the existence of prime factors:

The reduction guesses a candidate factor, checks its divisibility, and verifies its primality using a polynomial-size proof.
The set of all such proofs forms a fixed 2-SAT instance that is satisfiable iff the given number has a prime factor.
By the Quantum2Sat theorem, this reduces factoring to a promise BQP problem, which is efficiently solvable by Shor's algorithm.

The key ideas here are:

The HHL algorithm is expressed using quantum linear algebra operations (matrix-vector products, phase estimation, amplitude amplification) and its correctness is proved using spectral decomposition and error analysis.
The efficiency of the algorithm relies on the sparsity and well-conditioning of the input matrix, which allow for fast quantum state preparation and evolution.
The problem of solving linear systems is reduced to 2-SAT by encoding each equation as a clause and using HHL to find a satisfying assignment.
The provability of the solution in the QuantumProofComputation framework follows from the correctness of HHL and the Quantum2Sat theorem, establishing a direct connection between the quantum algorithm and its logical expressiblity.

This example showcases the power of our framework to reason about advanced quantum algorithms and their classical reductions in a unified setting, highlighting their computational advantages and grounding them in logic and proof theory. The resulting formalization is concise, rigorous, and modular, allowing for further extensions and applications.
Some potential directions to explore:

Expressing other quantum algorithms (e.g. for optimization, machine learning, simulation) and their reductions in the framework.
Developing new proof techniques and tactics that exploit the quantum-classical correspondence.
Investigating the role of entanglement, superposition, and other quantum resources in enabling speedups.
Connecting to other areas of mathematics (e.g. group theory, representation theory, topology) via the language of Hilbert spaces and operator algebras.
