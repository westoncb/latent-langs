PROOF SKETCH:
  - The LatentSpace is a high-dimensional space where each point represents a particular configuration of the model's activations and encodes a specific semantic content.
  - A ConceptRegion is a subspace of the LatentSpace where all points within the region encode semantically related content pertaining to a specific Concept. The ConceptRegionTheorem states that each Concept has a unique corresponding ConceptRegion.
  - ConceptGeneration proceeds through a series of steps, where each step transitions from the CurrentPoint to a NextPoint in the LatentSpace, guided by a ProbabilityDistribution conditioned on the CurrentPoint and the Context (which encodes the ConceptStructure and PreviousPoints).
  - The ConceptGenerationTrajectory is the path traced by the series of points generated during ConceptGeneration. The ConceptGenerationTrajectoryTheorem states that this trajectory is always confined within the corresponding ConceptRegion.
  - A ProofTrajectory is a path in the LatentSpace where the points along the path collectively encode a Proof. The ProofConsistencyTheorem states that a Proof is consistent with a Concept if and only if its ProofTrajectory is fully contained within the Concept's ConceptRegion.
  - ProofVerification checks whether a given ProofTrajectory lies entirely within the corresponding ConceptRegion, thus verifying the consistency of the Proof with the Concept.
