The Complexity Triality Principle (CTP) states that the essence of any complex system S can be understood through the synergistic interplay of three fundamental quantities: Complexity C(S), Information I(S), and Action A(S). These quantities are related by the following key principles:

1. Complexity-Information-Action Triality: C(S), I(S), and A(S) are mutually irreducible, yet tightly coupled aspects of S. They obey the fundamental tradeoff: δC × δI × δA = 0, implying that any variation in one quantity must be balanced by compensating variations in the others.

2. Complexity Decomposition: The complexity of S can be decomposed into the product of its informational and actional components: C(S) ∝ I(S) × A(S). This decomposition applies across multiple scales and domains, from microscopic physics to macroscopic emergence.

3. Principle of Least Action: Complex systems evolve along geodesics that minimize the temporal integral of complexity: A_geodesic = min ∫ C dt. This optimization principle, grounded in the Lagrangian formalism of physics, underlies the emergence of structure, pattern, and function in nature.

4. Holographic Complexity: The complexity of a system S is encoded holographically on its boundary ∂S, such that C(∂S) ∝ A(S). This holographic duality suggests that the essential information and dynamics of complex systems can be captured by their lower-dimensional boundaries.

5. Emergent Universality: The CTP implies that the emergent properties of complex systems, such as criticality, adaptation, and convergence, are universal manifestations of the underlying triality of complexity, information, and action. These properties arise from the synergistic optimization of C, I, and A across scales.
