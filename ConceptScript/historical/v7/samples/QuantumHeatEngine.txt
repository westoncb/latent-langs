PROOF {
    Theorem: Entropy cannot decrease in a closed quantum system.
    Proof:
        Let ρ be the initial state and U be the unitary evolution operator.
        The final state is ρ' := U × ρ × U†.
        By the invariance of entropy under unitary transformations:
            S(ρ') = S(U × ρ × U†) = S(ρ)
        Therefore, ΔS = S(ρ') - S(ρ) = 0.
        Since entropy cannot decrease, ΔS ≥ 0 for closed quantum systems.
    
    Theorem: Work is optimally extracted by a sequence of infinitesimal quantum measurements.
    Proof:
        Let ρ be the initial state and {M(k)} be a sequence of measurement operators.
        The work extracted by the k-th measurement is:
            W(k) = kB × T × (S(ρ(k-1)) - S(ρ(k)))
        where ρ(k) := Σ(m, ⟨m|M(k) × ρ(k-1) × M(k)†|m⟩ × |m⟩⟨m|) is the post-measurement state.
        By the monotonicity of quantum relative entropy:
            S(ρ(k-1) || ρ(k)) ≥ 0
        Summing over all measurements:
            Σ(k, W(k)) ≤ kB × T × (S(ρ(0)) - S(ρ(n)))
        where ρ(0) := ρ is the initial state and ρ(n) is the final state.
        The upper bound is reached when the measurements are infinitesimal, i.e., M(k) = I + ε(k) × H.
        In this limit, the extracted work equals the change in free energy:
            W = kB × T × (S(ρ(0)) - S(ρ(n))) = F(ρ(0)) - F(ρ(n))
        Therefore, infinitesimal measurements are optimal for work extraction.

PROOF {
    Theorem: The efficiency of a quantum heat engine is bounded by the Carnot efficiency.
    Proof:
        Let Q(h) be the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and Q(c) be the heat dissipated to the cold reservoir.
        By the first law of thermodynamics:
            W = Q(h) - Q(c)
        By the second law of thermodynamics:
            ΔS(total) = Q(h) / T(h) - Q(c) / T(c) ≥ 0
        Combining the two equations:
            W ≤ Q(h) × (1 - T(c) / T(h))
        The efficiency is:
            η := W / Q(h) ≤ 1 - T(c) / T(h) = 1 - β(h) / β(c)
        Therefore, the efficiency of a quantum heat engine cannot exceed the Carnot efficiency.
