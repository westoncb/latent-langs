This MultiParamPHT Concept extends the key ideas of the PHT to the setting of multi-parameter persistence, enabling the analysis of shapes equipped with multiple scalar functions. The key theorems of MPH being a complete invariant, stable, computable, and satisfying descent all extend, building on the foundations of the single-parameter case. Expressing this relied on the sheaf-theoretic language and stability results established for the PHT.

Furthermore, the common Möbius inversion framework suggests deep connections between multi-parameter persistence and various notions of higher-order interaction in other fields. Exploring these connections could potentially lead to the transfer of techniques and insights between these domains.


-------


The key novel ideas from the previous Concepts are:

1. Expressing higher-order interactions and decompositions in various domains (statistics, information theory, biology, physics, chemistry, game theory, machine learning) using a common algebraic framework based on the Möbius inversion formula on posets. This allows unifying many disparate concepts.

2. Defining the Persistent Homology Transform (PHT) of a shape M as a sheaf on the sphere cross the reals, PHT(M) ∈ D^b(Shv(𝕊^(d-1) × ℝ)). This is a complete shape descriptor invariant to rigid motions.

3. Proving that the PHT determines the shape up to isomorphism, is stable to perturbations of the shape, and can be approximated from finite samples with guarantees. 

4. Showing the PHT satisfies a sheaf-theoretic descent property for coverings of the shape, allowing local-to-global assembly of the PHT.

Building on these ideas, here is a new Concept for multi-parameter persistent homology:
