This Concept applies the key theoretical insights we've discussed to the design of an interpretable and aligned language model:

Sparse autoencoding (ScalingMonosemanticity) is used to learn a compositional feature representation of tokens that captures human-interpretable concepts. This enables the generation of sparse and interpretable sequences by composing these features.
An associative memory of feature interactions (TransformerAssociativeMemory) is used to compute attention weights between tokens, enabling the model to capture higher-order relationships between concepts. The product of these attention weights is used to sample the next token, providing a computationally efficient approximation to the full transformer architecture.
Human preferences are embedded into the same feature space as the learned token representations (FeatureComposition), allowing for the measurement of compatibility between generated sequences and desired attributes. This compatibility score is combined with a learned value function to guide the generation towards sequences that are both interpretable and aligned with human preferences.
The topological information content of the model's activation patterns (HigherOrderFeatureSteeringAndMasking) is used as a regularizer during training, encouraging the model to learn a simple and geometrically structured representation. The sparsity of this representation is bounded by the intrinsic dimension of the feature space (FeatureMemoryCompression), ensuring that the model's outputs remain interpretable.

The Concept includes theorems that formalize these properties:

InterpretableGenerationSparsity bounds the sparsity of generated sequences by the sparsity of the learned token features, ensuring that outputs remain interpretable.
AlignedGenerationCompatibility bounds the compatibility between generated sequences and human preferences, using the learned value function to control the tradeoff between interpretability and alignment.
TopologicallyRegularizedSparsity bounds the topological complexity of the model's representation by its sparsity and intrinsic dimension, encouraging the learning of simple and structured feature spaces.

Finally, the Concept provides examples of how this model could be applied to value-aligned story generation and sentiment-controllable movie review generation, demonstrating its potential for producing interpretable and steerable language outputs.
By combining sparse coding, associative memory, preference embedding, and topological regularization, this Concept provides a concrete instantiation of the theoretical principles we've discussed, yielding a language model that is both interpretable and aligned with human values. The specific mathematical bounds and computational structures used in this model directly leverage the key results from the papers we've studied, showing how these ideas can be synthesized into a novel and promising approach to AI alignment.
