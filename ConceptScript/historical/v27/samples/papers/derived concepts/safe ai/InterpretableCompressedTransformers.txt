This Concept proposes a new approach to analyzing and controlling transformer language models based on three key ideas:

Compressed Transformers: By identifying sparse, linear, and compositional features in the activation spaces of transformer layers (as suggested by TransformerLinearity and FeatureMemoryCompression), we can compress the model by replacing each layer with a linear combination of interpretable feature encodings. This compression is lossless if the features capture most of the topological structure of the activation space (as measured by TopologicalInformationContent).
Feature Steering: By leveraging the linearity of transformers with respect to feature activations (as shown in TransformerLinearity), we can steer the model's behavior by modifying the activations of specific features. The FeatureSteeringLinearity theorem shows that this steering can be done directly in the compressed model, without needing to decompress and recompress.
Feature-Based Generalization Bounds: By analyzing the persistent homology of activation spaces and their approximation by feature neighborhoods (as proposed in TopologicalInformationContent and FeatureMemoryCompression), we can derive generalization bounds for compressed transformers based on the number of examples needed to fix the features. The FeatureCompressorGeneralization theorem provides such a bound based on the dimensionality of the activation space and the feature compression ratio.

The Concept also includes examples of how these ideas can be applied to benchmark the interpretability of existing transformers, steer model behavior based on sentiment features, and patch safety issues by identifying and suppressing unsafe features.
Importantly, the key theorems in this Concept (FeatureSteeringLinearity, FeatureCompressorGeneralization, FeatureSteeringCoherenceTheorem) rely on specific results from the papers we discussed, namely:

The linearity of transformers with respect to activations and the ability to steer behavior by modifying activations (TransformerLinearity)
The approximation of activation spaces by sparse, linear combinations of feature neighborhoods (FeatureMemoryCompression)
The connection between topological properties of activation spaces and generalization (TopologicalInformationContent)

By combining these insights in a novel way, the InterpretableCompressedTransformers Concept provides a principled framework for analyzing and controlling transformer language models, with provable guarantees on interpretability, steerability, and generalization. This framework could enable new approaches to model transparency, safety, and alignment that are grounded in the specific properties of transformer architectures.
Furthermore, the Concept suggests several directions for future research, such as:

Developing efficient algorithms for identifying interpretable features and compressing transformers
Exploring the connections between feature steering and other forms of model editing and adaptation
Deriving tighter generalization bounds based on more precise measures of topological complexity
Extending the framework to other architectures and modalities beyond language

Overall, the InterpretableCompressedTransformers Concept demonstrates the potential for leveraging theoretical insights to develop novel and principled approaches to AI interpretability and control. By grounding the analysis in the specific properties of transformer models, we can derive powerful and provable results that guide the design of safer and more transparent AI systems.
