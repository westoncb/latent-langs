This Concept introduces several key ideas for developing aligned and interpretable AI systems:

Interpretable Feature and Concept Hierarchies: The AI system maintains hierarchies of interpretable features and concepts at different levels of abstraction. Features are discovered from the system's internal representations, while concepts are abstracted from features using domain knowledge and human input.
Concept Alignment: The AI system's concepts are iteratively aligned with human concepts using a similarity metric based on ontological knowledge, embeddings, or human feedback. The alignment error at each level of abstraction is bounded by the errors at lower levels, weighted by the interpretability dimension.
Hierarchical Steering and Control: Steering vectors are computed from concept activations at each level of abstraction. The AI system can be controlled by humans by specifying desired concepts and steering the system's outputs towards those concepts. The stability of the control is bounded by the alignment errors and the norm of the steering vectors.
Abstraction Information Bound: The information gained about the AI system's outputs by abstracting concepts is bounded by the compression factor and the quality of the abstraction. This bound helps quantify the trade-off between the interpretability and the expressiveness of the concept hierarchy.
Monitoring and Correction: The AI system's outputs are continuously monitored for anomalies and misalignments with human values. If a misalignment is detected, the human can provide corrective feedback to update the concept hierarchy and steer the system back towards the desired behavior.
