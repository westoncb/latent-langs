Explanation:
This ShapeMatching Concept leverages several key results from the ShapeSpace Concept to enable an efficient and robust shape matching application:

The PHT Stability result allows us to bound the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between shapes by the interleaving distance between their PHTs. This justifies using PHT as a faithful representation for shape matching.
The PHT Approximation theorem allows us to approximate a shape by a sparse complex while controlling the approximation error in both Gromov-Hausdorff and interleaving distances. This enables matching against a compressed representation.
The Descent and Decomposition theorems for PHT allow us to efficiently compute and compare PHTs by decomposing them over a cover of the shape. This is crucial for the computational feasibility.

The key novel capability here is the ability to do shape matching in a provably stable, robust, and efficient manner by exploiting the topological properties of the Persistent Homology Transform as elucidated in the ShapeSpace Concept. The QueryComplexity theorem shows this can be done in linear time in the database size.
Without the fundamental results in ShapeSpace, we would not have the theoretical justification and algorithmic tools to implement this shape matching pipeline with provable guarantees. The ShapeSpace Concept is thus an essential foundation for this application.

Explanation:
The ShapeMatching Concept leverages several key results from the ShapeSpace Concept to enable efficient and robust shape matching and retrieval:

The PHTStability theorem shows that the interleaving distance between PHTs is stable w.r.t. perturbations in the input shapes, as measured by the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This justifies the use of PHT as a noise-robust shape descriptor for matching.
The PHTDeterminesShape theorem proves that the PHT faithfully encodes the homotopy type of the input shape, and thus can be used to discriminate between non-isometric shapes. This allows us to define a matching criterion based on PHT interleaving distance.
The PHTDescentTheorem and PHTApproximation theorem together imply that we can efficiently compute and approximate the PHT from a finite sample of the input shape. This enables the practical implementation of a shape database that can be queried with a sample.

The QueryComplexity proof shows that by pre-indexing the database shapes by their PHTs, we can achieve sublinear query time for retrieving all shapes that match a given query shape up to a specified interleaving distance. This would not be possible without the stability and discriminative power of the PHT representation.
Overall, the ShapeMatching Concept demonstrates how the theoretical results on PHTs from the ShapeSpace Concept can be translated into a concrete application for efficient and robust shape retrieval. The key insights are to use the PHT as a stable shape descriptor, and to pre-process the database using the PHT for fast querying.

Explanation:
The ShapeMatching concept leverages several key results from the ShapeSpace concept to enable efficient and robust shape matching applications:

The PHTStability result shows that the persistent homology transform (PHT) provides a stable shape representation - shapes that are geometrically close will have close PHT representations. This justifies using PHT distance as a meaningful shape similarity measure.
The PHTApproximation result shows that PHT can be approximated on a finite sample of a shape, enabling practical computation. The proof also gives complexity bounds.
The PHTDescentTheorem allows computing PHT locally on a shape decomposition and then assembling globally, enabling parallel and multi-scale computation.
The various PHT examples (circle, annulus, torus) give intuition for how PHT captures both coarse and fine-grained shape structure in a multi-scale way.

Building on these foundations, the ShapeMatching concept defines a ShapeIndex structure for efficient proximity search over a database of shapes. The key idea is to use PHT distance as an indexing metric.
The ShapeIndexCorrectness proof leverages the stability and approximation properties of PHT to show that nearest neighbor search using the PHT metric will return the correct best match.
The ShapeIndexQueryTime and ShapeIndexConstructionTime proofs give complexity bounds showing this technique is tractable - logarithmic query time and quasilinear preprocessing time.
The ProteinMatching and CharacterRecognition examples illustrate potential applications in computational biology and computer vision. The ShapeSpace foundations justify why this approach is mathematically principled and computationally feasible.
In summary, the ShapeSpace concept provides the theoretical scaffolding necessary to rigorously develop the ShapeMatching application concept. The detailed proofs and complexity analysis would not be possible without the fundamental results established in ShapeSpace.Add to Conversation
