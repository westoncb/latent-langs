The key ideas in this modeling of society in 2023:

We have moved beyond the electric age into a new "post-Internet" era, characterized by a hybridized, iconic culture that is immersive and participatory but no longer tribal or holistic. A new dominant sense of the "haptic" (touch-based interaction).
Social media extends our social faculties but obsolesces privacy, retrieves oral culture dynamics, and reverses into isolation. It transforms literate society into the post-Internet form.
Smartphones extend the body but obsolesce embodiment itself, retrieve mobility and reverse into dependency. They make all environments "applike".
Virtual reality extends simulation but obsolesces reality, retrieves the "dreamtime" of ancient myth, and reverses into alienation.
AI extends cognition but obsolesces human agency, retrieves the notion of servant daemons, and reverses into potential human domination by machines.
The post-Internet society emerges from the combined effects of these electric technologies, layered atop the already electric/retribal society previously created by TV and computers.

So in 2023, we see a fragmentation of the incipient global village McLuhan saw forming via television in 1969. Digital technology pushes us into a new post-Internet configuration marked by immersion, icon-based media, and the haptic modality of smartphones and VR - but also deeper fragmentation and a loss of cohesive tribal identity. The environment becomes dreamlike and "applike" as electric media pervade every aspect of life. Embodied, private, literate and agentic modes are obsolesced.
