In this Concept, we introduce types for protein structures, amino acids, and structural motifs. The key idea is to decompose a protein structure into its constituent secondary structural motifs (e.g., α-helices, β-sheets) and compute the PHT for each motif. The PHT of the entire protein is then the direct sum of the motif PHTs.
We define a distance between proteins based on the interleaving distance of their PHTs. Similarly, we define a similarity measure between structural motifs. These allow us to compare proteins and identify conserved structural patterns.
For protein classification, we introduce the notion of a protein family and define a consensus structure and motif signature for a family. A protein is classified into a family if it contains all the signature motifs of the family, up to a certain tolerance.
The proofs section includes a theorem showing the stability of this classification scheme: if a protein has motifs that are sufficiently similar to a family's signature motifs, then it will be classified into that family.
This Concept demonstrates how the ShapeSpace framework can be extended and applied to a specific domain. The PHT provides a robust way to encode and compare the shapes of proteins and their substructures, enabling various analyses and classifications.
Of course, this is a simplified model and there are many more aspects of protein structure and function that could be incorporated. But it illustrates the potential of using topological and sheaf-theoretic tools in computational biology.
