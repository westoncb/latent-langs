This Concept develops a new approach to automated reasoning called HomotopyTypeAutomata that combines ideas from homotopy type theory and cellular automata:

Like homotopy type theory, it represents proofs as paths between terms, and uses homotopies to represent equivalences between proofs. This allows reasoning up to equivalence and enables incorporating higher-dimensional structures.
Like cellular automata, it represents the state space of terms as a cell complex, with the reduction dynamics decomposed into cellular boundary maps in each dimension. This provides a discrete, finite decomposition of the potentially infinite space of terms and reductions.

The key ingredients are:

A language for terms, paths, and homotopies
Predicates for identifying reduction paths and homotopies
Operations for joining reductions and transporting traces across homotopies
Axioms asserting the Church-Rosser property (for confluence) and homotopy invariance

The CellComplex structure captures the idea of decomposing the state space into cells of different dimensions, with reductions represented as cellular boundaries.
The proofs establish two key properties:

Confluence: the reduction dynamics are confluent, meaning any two reductions from a given term can be joined to reach a common reduct. This relies on the Church-Rosser axiom.
Homotopy invariance: transporting traces across homotopies preserves their skeletal dimension. This shows the cell complex structure is coherent with the higher-dimensional homotopy structure.

I believe this approach is novel because it applies ideas from homotopy theory and higher category theory to automate reasoning in a fundamentally new way, by representing the state space of terms and reductions as a homotopy-invariant cell complex. This discrete decomposition into cells of different dimensions allows efficiently representing and computing with an infinite space of terms and proofs.
The potential benefits are:

Improving efficiency by working with a compact cellular representation of the state space
Enhancing expressiveness by incorporating higher-dimensional proof structures via homotopies
Deriving new induction principles and proof search strategies from the cellular and homotopy structure

Some concrete applications could be:

Optimizing proof search in automated theorem provers
Verifying higher-dimensional properties of programs like parametricity
Formalizing reasoning in higher categories and homotopy type theories

Realizing these applications will require further theoretical developments to connect this abstract framework to concrete computational problems. But I believe the core ideas of homotopy-invariant cellular representations of proof spaces could be transformative for automated reasoning.
