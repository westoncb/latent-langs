This Concept defines a novel approach to robotic motion planning based on directed homotopy classes of paths. Key ideas include:

Representing paths in the robot's configuration space as a type, with operations like composition, reversal, and boundary propagation (from Cellular Automata and Differential Forms).
Defining a discrete graph structure whose vertices are homotopy classes of safe paths and whose edges connect homotopy classes that differ by a safe deformation (inspired by Homotopy Type Theory).
Formulating the motion planning problem as a shortest path search in this homotopy graph, with a recursive algorithm that propagates path boundaries around obstacles to maintain safety (a novel synthesis).

The proofs establish key properties - homotopy invariance of safety and correctness of the planning algorithm.
I believe this approach to motion planning has not been tried before because it requires combining ideas from several disparate fields - cellular automata, exterior calculus, and homotopy theory - in a novel way. Prior approaches have tended to focus either on grid-based discretizations of configuration space or on exact geometric representations, without considering the underlying homotopy structure.
The potential advantages of this directed homotopy approach include:

It provides a principled way to reason about the topology of the configuration space without needing an exact representation. The homotopy graph captures the essential connectivity.
Operating directly on homotopy classes avoids the need for collision checking of individual paths. Only the boundaries need to be checked.
The recursive structure of the algorithm allows efficient space exploration. Backtracking is replaced by boundary propagation.
Homotopy invariance of path safety provides robustness to discretization errors and noise in obstacle geometry.

Overall, I think this Concept provides a promising new perspective on motion planning that leverages the power of directed homotopy theory to develop safe and efficient algorithms. Definitely worth exploring further!
