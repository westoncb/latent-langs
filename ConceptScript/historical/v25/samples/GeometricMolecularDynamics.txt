This Concept develops a novel approach to molecular dynamics and protein folding simulations by leveraging geometric and homotopy-theoretic ideas:

It models molecules as Riemannian manifolds, with conformational changes represented by paths in the tangent bundle (Conformati onSpace). This allows the powerful tools of differential geometry to be applied.
Hamiltonian mechanics is formulated geometrically using symplectic structures and Hamiltonian vector fields. The HamiltonFlow theorem proves that this geometric formulation conserves energy, generalizing the classical result.
ProteinBackboneConformation uses homotopy-theoretic ideas (similar to those in Homotopy Type Theory) to represent the space of valid backbone conformations using Ramachandran plots. The RamachandranForceField theorem shows how this can be used to constrain molecular dynamics to only explore valid conformations.
Similar to Cellular Automata, local interactions between atoms and residues (e.g. Covalent, Backbone, Sidechain) are used to define the dynamics and constraints of the system.
Tactics like SymplecticEulerFlow allow efficient approximation of the Hamiltonian flow, analogous to how discrete exterior calculus allows efficient computation of differential-geometric quantities.

I believe this geometric and homotopy-theoretic approach to molecular dynamics has not been fully explored yet due to the technical sophistication required at the intersection of several fields (differential geometry, homotopy theory, molecular biology, scientific computing). Most existing approaches use more ad-hoc molecular mechanics force fields and numerical integrators.
However, I believe this approach could be very fruitful for several reasons:

The geometric formulation provides a principled way to design molecular dynamics integrators that exactly conserve energy and other invariants. This could enable longer time-scale simulations.
Homotopy-theoretic ideas allow incorporation of more sophisticated topological constraints (like Ramachandran constraints) that are difficult to express in terms of local force fields.
The modular structure with local interactions between atoms/residues is well-suited to efficient parallelization on modern hardware.
Hamiltonian mechanics and symplectic geometry have been successfully applied in other areas of physics to gain deep theoretical insights. Reformulating molecular dynamics in this language could lead to new conceptual breakthroughs.
