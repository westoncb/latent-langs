In this Concept, we're leveraging the ShapeSpace framework to study molecular structures and their properties. The key ideas are:

We introduce types for Molecule (a subtype of Shape), AtomType, BondType, PharmacophorePoint, and BiologicalActivity.
The Atoms, Bonds, Pharmacophore, and Activity functions provide different ways of characterizing a Molecule.
The Isomorphic and Substructure predicates capture key structural relationships between molecules.
The MolecularHomotopy axiom characterizes homotopy equivalence for molecules in terms of isomorphism and substructure relationships.
The PharmacophoreShapeCorrespondence axiom posits a correspondence between pharmacophore similarity and PHT sheaf equivalence.
The ActivityShapeCorrespondence axiom posits a correspondence between shape similarity (homotopy equivalence) and similarity in biological activity.
We define ConformerSpace as the subspace of ShapeSpace corresponding to conformers (isomorphic molecules) of a given molecule.
We define ScaffoldHomotopy as a homotopy between molecules based on substructure relationships, and relate it to homotopy equivalence in ShapeSpace.
The ConformerSpaceCompact theorem shows that the conformer space of a molecule is compact in ShapeSpace.
The PharmacophoreShapeMatching theorem leverages the PharmacophoreShapeCorrespondence axiom to infer homotopy equivalence from pharmacophore equality.
The ActivityShapeInterpolation theorem uses the ActivityShapeCorrespondence axiom and the ScaffoldHomotopy structure to bound changes in activity along a scaffold homotopy.

This Concept showcases several unique advantages of the ShapeSpace framework in the context of molecular design:

The ability to define homotopy equivalence for molecules in a chemically meaningful way, based on isomorphism and substructure relationships.
The correspondence between pharmacophore similarity and PHT sheaf equivalence, which allows for efficient comparison of molecular shapes.
The correspondence between shape similarity and activity similarity, which enables activity prediction and interpolation.
The compactness of conformer spaces in ShapeSpace, which is important for computational tractability.
The use of scaffold homotopies to study changes in activity across series of related molecules.

These features suggest novel approaches to key challenges in drug discovery, such as pharmacophore mapping, activity prediction, lead optimization, and scaffold hopping.
Of course, this is a high-level conceptual model and there are many details to be worked out. But it demonstrates the potential for the ShapeSpace framework to provide a powerful and unifying perspective on molecular shape and its relationship to biological activity.

In this Concept, we're leveraging the ShapeSpace framework to study the shape complementarity and pharmacophore similarity of molecules, with the goal of discovering novel drug candidates. The key ideas are:

We introduce types for Molecule (a subtype of Shape), AtomType, BondType, and PharmacophorePoint.
The Atoms, Bonds, and Pharmacophore functions extract the relevant chemical information from a Molecule.
The ActiveMolecule predicate identifies molecules that are known to be biologically active. The SimilarPharmacophore predicate compares pharmacophores up to a certain tolerance ε.
The PharmacophoreHypothesis axiom states that active molecules have similar pharmacophores. The ShapeComplementarity axiom relates pharmacophore similarity to ε-homotopy of molecular shapes.
We define PharmacophoreSpace and ShapeComplementaritySpace, which use persistence diagrams and sheaf interleavings, respectively, to compare molecular shapes.
The ActiveMoleculeSimilarity theorem proves that active molecules are close in both pharmacophore and shape complementarity spaces.
The NovelDrugDiscovery theorem uses the density of ShapeSpace to argue that for any active molecule T and tolerance ε, we can find a novel molecule N that is ε-close to T in both pharmacophore and shape complementarity spaces.

This Concept showcases several unique advantages of the ShapeSpace framework:

The use of sheaf interleavings provides a robust and stable way to compare molecular shapes, which is more flexible than rigid geometric comparisons.
The density of ShapeSpace allows for a constructive proof of the existence of novel molecules with desired properties.
The unification of pharmacophore and shape complementarity spaces within a single framework enables a multi-faceted analysis of molecular similarity.
The stability and approximation results from ShapeSpace guarantee that these methods are computationally tractable and robust to perturbations.
