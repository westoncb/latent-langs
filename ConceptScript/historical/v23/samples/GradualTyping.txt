This Concept formalizes some key ideas from gradual typing, a approach to mixing static and dynamic typing in programming languages:

The TDyn type represents the dynamic type.
The Consistent relation captures the notion of type consistency, which allows TDyn to be consistent with any type.
The CastsTo relation represents safe casts between types. It requires consistency but prohibits casting from TDyn to anything other than TDyn.
The GradualGuarantee theorem states that if a term t has a type T and reduces to a term u, then u has some type T' that is consistent with T. This captures the key soundness property of gradually typed languages.

The proof uses a helper tactic ConsistentTransitive to show that consistency is transitive, which follows from the transitivity of casting.
