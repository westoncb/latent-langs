In this abstract Concept, we capture the essence of converting between symbolic and embedded representations of knowledge, without tying it to specific formalisms or implementations.
The key components of this Concept are:

SymbolicRepresentation and EmbeddedRepresentation: These types represent the symbolic and embedded forms of knowledge, respectively. They serve as the building blocks for the system.
SymbolicToEmbedded and EmbeddedToSymbolic: These functions define the core transformations between symbolic and embedded representations. They encapsulate the process of abstracting symbolic knowledge into an embedded form and concretizing embedded knowledge back into a symbolic form.
KnowledgeRepresentation: This structure represents a unified knowledge representation that combines both symbolic and embedded forms. It provides operations for querying, reasoning, and validating knowledge in this combined representation.
SymbolicToEmbeddedTransformer and EmbeddedToSymbolicTransformer: These transformers define the actual processes of converting between symbolic and embedded representations. They apply a series of refinements, abstractions, concretizations, and mappings to achieve the conversion.
Consistency and Expressiveness theorems: These proofs capture the desired properties of the system. The Consistency theorem states that converting a symbolic representation to an embedded form and then back to symbolic should yield an equivalent representation. The Expressiveness theorem asserts that the embedded representation can express all the knowledge contained in the symbolic representation, and potentially more.

The essence of this Concept lies in the interplay between symbolic and embedded representations of knowledge. It captures the idea that knowledge can be represented in both forms, and that there exist well-defined transformations between them.
The symbolic representation provides a structured, interpretable, and compositional form of knowledge, while the embedded representation offers a dense, continuous, and potentially more expressive form. The system aims to leverage the strengths of both representations by enabling seamless conversion and combination.
The transformers and theorems emphasize the importance of consistency and expressiveness in this conversion process. The system should ensure that the symbolic and embedded representations are equivalent in terms of the knowledge they capture, while also allowing for the embedded representation to potentially express knowledge beyond what is explicitly represented symbolically.
This abstract Concept provides a foundation for exploring the integration of symbolic and embedded knowledge representations in a general sense. It can be instantiated and applied to various domains and formalisms, guiding the development of systems that bridge the gap between symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches to knowledge representation and reasoning.

In this implementation Concept, we provide a concrete realization of the symbolic-to-embedded knowledge system, focusing on the practical aspects of loading, querying, reasoning, and validating knowledge.
The key components of this implementation are:

SymbolicKnowledgeBase and EmbeddedKnowledgeBase: These types represent the concrete data structures for storing symbolic and embedded knowledge, respectively. The symbolic knowledge base consists of an ontology, facts, and rules, while the embedded knowledge base contains embeddings for entities, relations, and facts.
SymbolicToEmbeddedKBImpl: This structure encapsulates the implementation of the symbolic-to-embedded knowledge system. It provides methods for loading a symbolic knowledge base, converting it to an embedded representation, querying the embedded knowledge, performing reasoning, validating knowledge, and saving the embedded knowledge base.
Query, Reason, and Validate methods: These methods demonstrate the practical usage of the symbolic-to-embedded knowledge system.

The Query method takes a query string, parses it into a structured representation, converts it to an embedded representation, performs nearest neighbor search in the embedded space, and retrieves relevant knowledge.
The Reason method takes a premise string, converts it to an embedded representation, performs reasoning using vector operations and transformations, converts the conclusion back to symbolic form, and renders it into a human-readable format.
The Validate method takes a piece of knowledge, converts it to an embedded representation, and checks its consistency with the existing embedded knowledge base.


Save method: This method allows saving the embedded knowledge base to a specified path, enabling persistence and reuse of the learned embeddings.
QueryEffectiveness and ReasoningCorrectnessAndEfficiency theorems: These proofs capture the desired properties of the implementation.

The QueryEffectiveness theorem states that the precision and recall of the query results should be above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.8) when compared to the expected results.
The ReasoningCorrectnessAndEfficiency theorem asserts that the reasoning process should produce conclusions that match the expected conclusions and that the reasoning time should be within a specified limit (e.g., 5 seconds).



This implementation Concept provides a concrete example of how the symbolic-to-embedded knowledge system can be realized in practice. It demonstrates the flow of loading symbolic knowledge, converting it to an embedded representation, performing queries, reasoning, and validation using the embedded knowledge, and saving the embedded knowledge base for future use.
The implementation highlights the importance of efficient and effective methods for querying, reasoning, and validating knowledge in the embedded space. It also emphasizes the need for seamless conversion between symbolic and embedded representations to enable practical usage of the system.
