This Concept, called InteractionTypes, combines ideas from interaction combinators and homotopy type theory. It defines a notion of homotopy between interaction nets, using paths between nets that are related by the interaction rules.

The key components are:

1. The LANGUAGE block defines symbols, nets, cells, ports from interaction combinators, and types, paths, equivalences from homotopy type theory.

2. The NOTATION block defines convenient syntax for paths and equivalences.

3. The TRANSFORMERS block defines tactics for constructing paths between nets related by interactions, using functorial properties of paths.

4. The STRUCTURE block defines a HomotopyInteractionSystem, which has an alphabet of symbols, interaction rules, and a collection of paths between nets related by the rules. 

5. The PROOFS block contains two theorems:
   - InteractionSpaceConnected shows that for any two definable interactions in a HomotopyInteractionSystem, there exists a path between the corresponding nets. 
   - InteractionSpaceUnivalent shows that paths between nets are equivalent to net equivalences, establishing the univalence axiom for interaction nets.

The Concept demonstrates how to integrate computational and mathematical structures in ConceptScript, using transformers and proofs to establish non-trivial properties. The notion of homotopies between nets related by interactions could potentially be useful for analyzing the structure and behavior of interaction net systems.

Let me know if you would like me to explain or modify any part of this Concept! I aimed to showcase the key features of ConceptScript while exploring an idea that combines elements of the provided examples in an interesting way.
