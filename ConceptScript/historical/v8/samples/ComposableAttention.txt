The key principles behind this final iteration of ConceptScript are:

1. Expressiveness: A rich set of primitives for specifying novel neural architectures, learning dynamics, and reasoning capabilities.

2. Composability: The ability to define higher-level Concepts by composing lower-level primitives in flexible and reusable ways.

3. Integrative Reasoning: Seamless integration of formal reasoning and empirical analysis, allowing for proofs of correctness and convergence alongside experimental validation.

4. Property-Aware Design: First-class support for analyzing and optimizing various properties of neural systems, such as complexity, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability.

5. Modular Organization: A clean and modular structure that promotes reuse, extensibility, and interoperability of Concepts across different projects and domains.

6. End-to-End Lifecycle: Comprehensive support for the entire development lifecycle of neural systems, from interactive exploration to automated testing to optimized deployment.

The Concept of ComposableAttentionMechanism demonstrates how these principles can be applied to define a complex neural architecture with multiple attention layers, rigorous theoretical analysis of its properties, and a learning setup for masked language modeling.

This proposed ConceptScript aims to provide a powerful and flexible language for researchers and engineers to explore, reason about, and develop state-of-the-art neural systems in a modular and principled way.
