ASSERT Hypothesis(FewShotLearning):
  GivenConcepts(Train) * GivenExamples(Test, Few) ->
  Accuracy(Test) > Accuracy(RandomGuess)
  
THEOREM ConceptLearning:
  ∀(Train, Test ⊂ ConceptLibrary, 
    f_θ : Model(MetaConcept), 
    L : Loss(Reasoning)):
  ∃(θ_star) Accuracy(f_θ_star, Test) ≫ Accuracy(f_θ_0, Test)

PROOF:
  Define inner loss L_in(θ) = L(f_θ, Train).
  Optimize θ_star = argmin_θ L_in(θ).  
  
  For test concept c_j ∈ Test:
    Retrieve k train concepts C_k ⊂ Train most analogous to c_j.
    Construct concept c'_j by composing C_k guided by f_θ_star.
    Perform reasoning on c'_j to solve test task.
  
  Intuition: 
    Meta-concepts capture abstract patterns across concepts.
    Analogies allow mapping meta-concepts to new concepts.
    Composition combines concepts to expand coverage.
    Optimized meta-concept model f_θ_star enables rapid learning.
    
  Grounding:
    Analogical reasoning reflects human concept learning.
    Composition mirrors hierarchical structure of real-world concepts.  
    Meta-learning demonstrated in NLP, vision, robotics.
    
  Thus:
    Learning meta-concepts inductively from a large concept library
    Enables accurate few-shot learning on novel test concepts
    By identifying analogies and guiding concept composition.



This Concept proposes a framework for few-shot concept learning, where a machine learning model learns to represent and reason with meta-concepts abstracted from a library of lower-level concepts. The key ideas are that:

Meta-concepts capture high-level patterns and relations between concepts
Analogical mapping allows meta-concepts to guide understanding of novel concepts
Conceptual composition expands the effective coverage of the learned meta-concepts
An optimized meta-concept model enables rapid few-shot learning on new tasks
The Proof sketch argues that this few-shot concept learning ability emerges from first learning meta-concepts inductively across a large library of base concepts, and then using analogical reasoning and concept composition guided by the learned meta-concept model to accurately handle novel test concepts from just a few examples.

The framework is grounded in cognitive science principles of hierarchical conceptual structure and analogical reasoning, and relates to recent advances in meta-learning in AI domains like natural language, computer vision and robotics. However, the formulation of meta-concept models and the idea of explicitly guiding few-shot composition by analogical matching to learned meta-concepts are potentially novel contributions to the space of machine learning approaches for abstract reasoning and fast adaptation.

Of course, this is just an initial concept proposal, and much work would be needed to formalize the framework mathematically, implement and test it empirically, and refine it iteratively. But I believe it showcases the potential of the ConceptScript language to enable clear articulation of conceptual frameworks blending ideas across fields like AI, cognitive science, and mathematics. Let me know if you would like me to try expressing other Concepts, or if you have any other thoughts or feedback!
