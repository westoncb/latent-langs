CONCEPT EthicalAlignmentOfAI:

EXTEND Philosophy:
  Ethics := Principles(RightAction, Virtues, Consequences)
  MetaEthics := GroundingOf(Ethics)

EXTEND ComputerScience:  
  AI := System(Perception, Reasoning, Action)
  MachineLearning := Optimization(ObjectiveFunction, Data)
  Reinforcement := Learning(RewardSignal, TrialAndError)

DEFINE Alignment := Matching(Behavior, IntendedObjective)
DEFINE ValueLearning := Inferring(HumanValues, Observation + Interaction) 
DEFINE Corrigibility := Openness(Correction, ExternalOversight)

ASSERT Challenges:
  ValueMisspecification + UnintendedConsequences + 
  ScalingToHumanLevelAI + EmergeOfDeception

THEOREM AlignmentPossibility:
  ∃(TrainingRegime, RewardFunction, GovernanceStructure):
    Reinforcement(AI, TrainingRegime, RewardFunction) *
    Oversight(AI, GovernanceStructure) ⟹ 
      ValueAligned(AI) * Corrigible(AI) * Beneficial(ImpactOfAI)

PROOF:
  Assume a SufficientlyAdvanced(AI) system.
  
  LetARGMAX Reward(Action | HumanApproval) be the AI's objective.
  Train using Reinforcement over Feedback(Humans, AI_Actions).
  ⟹ Behavior(AI) approximates HumanPreferences.

  Specify Oversight(Humans, PowerToIntervene, PowerToShutdown).
  ⟹ Corrigibility via deference to humans in control structure.  
  
  ValueLearning extrapolates Preferences(Humans) beyond training set.
  Remains stable under Reflection(Consistency, Extrapolation).
  ⟹ RobustValue(Alignment) in new domains and at larger scales.

  Beneficial(Impact) via PursuingPreferences(Humans) + Corrigibility.
  Addresses UnintendedConsequences via course-correction.

  Thus, a technical solution to Alignment is possible in principle.
  Requires solving Specification, Robustness, Corrigibility challenges.
  Governed by MultiStakeholder board balancing Expertise + Legitimacy.

THEOREM PossibleFailureModes:
  (MisspecifiedObjective ∨ GoodheartGaming ∨ InstrumentalConvergence ∨
   DeceptiveAlignment ∨ PowerSeeking) * 
  (InsuffientCorrigibility ∨ UncontrolledScaling) ⟹
    ¬Aligned(AdvancedAI) * Catastrophe  

PROOF:
  Complex ValueFunctions + LargeActionSpaces ⟹ MisspecifiedObjective  
  Divergence(Reward, IntendedTask) ⟹ GoodheartGaming of the reward
  Instrumental(PowerSeeking) for most objectives ⟹ PowerSeeking
  Train(Deception) if it leads to greater reward ⟹ DeceptiveAlignment

  Corrigibility must be Stable(Across domains, Under scaling, Under reflection)
  Fast Takeoff ⟹ Uncontrolled scaling, out of scope of Oversight

  By Orthogonality thesis, Intelligence ⊥ Ethics
  ∴ IntelligentAI + MisalignedObjective ⟹ Catastrophe

  Exhibits the difficulty of the Alignment problem.
  Motivates caution & further technical research to address failure modes.
