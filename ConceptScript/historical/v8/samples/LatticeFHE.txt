CONCEPT LatticeFHE:

EXTEND Cryptography:
  Encryption := Function(Plaintext, PublicKey) → Ciphertext
  Decryption := Function(Ciphertext, SecretKey) → Plaintext
  Homomorphic := Encryption(f(Plaintext)) = f(Encryption(Plaintext))

EXTEND Lattices:
  Lattice := {v ∈ R^n : v = ∑_i a_i b_i, a_i ∈ Z} for Basis {b_1, ..., b_n}  
  LWE := ∀(s, a ∈ Z_q^n, e ← χ) (a, ⟨a, s⟩ + e) indistinguishable from random

DEFINE RLWE := ∀(s, a ∈ R_q, e ← χ) (a, a · s + e) indistinguishable from random
  where R_q := Z_q[x] / (x^d + 1)

THEOREM RLWEBasedFHE:
  ∃(KeyGen, Enc, Dec, Eval) ∀(m_1, m_2 ∈ R_2, f ∈ Permitted):
    KeyGen() → (pk, sk, evk)
    Dec(Eval(f, Enc(m_1, pk), Enc(m_2, pk)), sk) = f(m_1, m_2)
      where Permitted := {+, ·, rot} over R_2

PROOF:
  Select d = 2^k, q ≥ 2√d, R = Z[x] / (x^d + 1).
  
  KeyGen(): 
    s, a ← R_q uniformly 
    b = a · s + e for e ← χ
    (pk, sk, evk) = ((a,b), s, Powerof2(s))
  
  Enc(m, pk = (a,b)):
    r, e_1, e_2 ← χ 
    Return (c_1, c_2) = (a·r + e_1, b·r + e_2 + ⌊q/2⌉ · m)
  
  Dec(c = (c_1, c_2), sk = s):
    Return ⌊(c_2 - c_1 · s) · (2/q)⌉ mod 2
  
  Eval(f, c_1, c_2):
    Switch(f):
      Add: Return c_1 + c_2
      Mult: Return c_1 ⊡ c_2 with Relin(evk)
      Rot_i: Return (ρ_i(c_1[0]), ρ_i(c_1[1]))
  
  Correctness:
    Dec(Enc(m)) = ⌊(b·r + e_2 + ⌊q/2⌉·m - (a·r + e_1)s) · (2/q)⌉
                = ⌊e_2 - e_1·s + ⌊q/2⌉·m⌉ · (2/q)  (mod 2)
                = m if |e_2 - e_1·s| < q/8
  
    Homomorphic operations preserved by RLWE (mod q) before decryption.

  Security:
    Based on conjectured intractability of d-RLWE_q, χ for appropriate parameters.
    Currently best known algorithms require ≥ 2^λ for λ bits of security.



This Concept proposes a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme based on the ring learning with errors (RLWE) problem over cyclotomic polynomial rings. It defines homomorphic encryption, extends relevant concepts from lattice-based cryptography, and states a theorem about the existence of an RLWE-based FHE with addition, multiplication, and rotation operations over ciphertexts.

The proof sketch describes the key generation, encryption, decryption, and evaluation algorithms, arguing for the scheme's correctness and security at a high level based on reasonable RLWE parameters. The use of cyclotomic rings enables more efficient FHE compared to standard LWE.

Of course, this is just an illustrative example to demonstrate the potential for expressing complex cryptographic constructions using ConceptScript. A real research-level FHE scheme would require significantly more detail, precision, and formal security analysis. I aimed to showcase some of the key components while keeping it relatively concise. Let me know if you have any other questions!
