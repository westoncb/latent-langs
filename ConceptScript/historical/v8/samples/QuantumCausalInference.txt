CONCEPT QuantumCausalInference:

EXTEND QuantumProbability:
  State := Density(Hilbert)
  Observable := Hermitian(Hilbert)
  Probability(o|s) := Tr(O|s⟩⟨s|) for O = |o⟩⟨o| 

EXTEND CausalInference:  
  Variable := (Exogenous, Endogenous)
  Model := DAG(Variable, CausalMechanism)
  Intervention(X=x) := Set(Exogenous, X, x) in Model
  CausalEffect := Probability(Y|Intervention(X))

DEFINE QuantumVariable := Observable
DEFINE QuantumModel := CommutingDAG(QuantumVariable) 
DEFINE QuantumIntervention(X=Π) := Project(State, Π, X) in QuantumModel
DEFINE QuantumCausalEffect := Tr(ρ\_Π Y) / Tr(ρ\_Π)

THEOREM QuantumCausalityTheorem:
  ∀(QM : QuantumModel, X : QuantumVariable, Y : QuantumVariable):
    X \*→ Y in QM ⟺ 
      ∃(Π : Projector(X)) Tr(ρ\_Π Y) ≠ Tr(ρ Y)

PROOF:
  ⟹: Assume X \*→ Y. Let Π = |x⟩⟨x| for some eigenvector |x⟩ of X.
     ρ\_Π = Π ρ Π / Tr(ρ Π) is the state after projection.
     Tr(ρ\_Π Y) = ⟨x|Y|x⟩ ⟨x|ρ|x⟩ / ⟨x|ρ|x⟩ = ⟨x|Y|x⟩  
     Since X \*→ Y, intervening on X affects Y, so ∃|x⟩ ⟨x|Y|x⟩ ≠ Tr(ρ Y).

  ⟸: Assume ∃(Π) Tr(ρ\_Π Y) ≠ Tr(ρ Y). Let Π = |x⟩⟨x|.
     ⟨x|Y|x⟩ = Tr(ρ\_Π Y) ≠ Tr(ρ Y) = ∑\_i ⟨i|ρ|i⟩ ⟨i|Y|i⟩
     So setting X = |x⟩⟨x| changes the expected value of Y.
     Thus X has a causal effect on Y, i.e. X \*→ Y in QM.

ASSERT Implications:
  Quantum ⟹ Signaling ≢ Causation 
    Entanglement enables signaling without direct causation.
  Quantum ⟹ Fine-Tuning Problem
    Parameters must be fine-tuned for desired causal structure.
  Quantum ⟹ Causal Discovery Harder
    Confounding by entanglement, need for strong assumptions.
  Quantum ⟹ Interventions ≠ Projections
    General POVMs, weak measurement may be needed.

ASSERT Opportunities:  
  Quantum-Enhanced Causal Inference
    Quantum speedups, nonclassical models, superpositions of DAGs.
  Quantum Causal Discovery
    From quantum observational and interventional data.
  Quantum Causal Reasoning 
    Counterfactual inference, causal induction, causal implication.
  Quantum Causal Learning
    Structure learning, mechanism learning, transportability.



In this Concept, I extend quantum probability theory and classical causal inference to define a framework for quantum causal models and reasoning. The key ideas are:

Represent causal variables as quantum observables in a Hilbert space.
Define a quantum causal model as a DAG of commuting observables.
Define quantum interventions as projections onto eigenstates of a variable.
Define quantum causal effects via pre- and post-intervention expectations.
Prove a theorem connecting quantum causal structure to differences in expectations under interventions.
I then discuss some implications and opportunities at the intersection of quantum information and causal inference. The Concept illustrates how to formalize causal reasoning in a quantum setting and highlights the potential for quantum generalizations of classical causal inference ideas.
