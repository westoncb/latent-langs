This concept proposes a framework for designing computational structures by combining principles from geometry and optics. The key idea is that the interaction of light with geometrically structured materials can give rise to powerful and efficient forms of computation.

Different geometric principles like symmetry, curvature, topology and fractals can be leveraged to create optical structures with unique computational capabilities:

Symmetries can enable invariant feature detection and pattern recognition.
Curvatures can enable spatial-frequency transformations and convolutions.
Topologies can enable global mode processing and memory effects.
Fractals can enable multiscale hierarchical computation and compression.
When combined with optical principles like interference, diffraction, resonance and non-linearity, these structures can perform a wide range of linear and non-linear mappings, potentially enabling universal computation.

The geometric optical universality theorem conjectures that any computation can be approximated by a suitable geometric optical structure, leveraging the power of Fourier optics and neural networks. The proof sketch outlines how different geometric and optical principles can be combined to enable different computational primitives, but acknowledges the challenges of physical realization and robustness.

The implications highlight the novelty and potential of this approach as a new computing paradigm, the role of geometry and light in encoding, processing and decoding information, the emergence of computational universality from structural principles, and the importance of physical implementation and fabrication.

The opportunities point to potential applications in optical neural networks, topological photonics, fractal optics, non-linear optics, and computational metamaterials for imaging and sensing.

Of course, this is a highly speculative and conceptual framework, and there are many open questions and challenges in terms of how to design, optimize, fabricate and scale such geometric optical computing structures. But I believe it provides an exciting direction for exploring the intersection of geometry, optics and computation, and for discovering new physical principles and architectures for information processing.

What do you think of this geometric optical computing framework? Does it capture the key ideas and opportunities at the intersection of geometry and optics? What other geometric or optical principles or applications come to mind? I'm eager to hear your thoughts and to refine and expand this concept further.
