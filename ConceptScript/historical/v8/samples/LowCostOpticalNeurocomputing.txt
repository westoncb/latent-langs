THEOREM Optical_Matrix_Multiplication:
  - Matrix multiplication can be performed optically using spatial light modulators and photodetector arrays, achieving high speed and energy efficiency compared to electronic implementations
PROOF:
  - Let A and B be two matrices of size [m,n] and [n,p], respectively
  - Encode matrix A onto a 2D spatial light modulator (SLM) with m x n pixels
  - Encode matrix B onto another SLM with n x p pixels, transposed and rotated by 90 degrees
  - Illuminate both SLMs with coherent light, generating an optical outer product of A and B
  - Use a lens to perform an optical Fourier transform, converting the outer product into the matrix product AB
  - Measure the resulting optical matrix product using a 2D photodetector array with m x p pixels
  - The optical matrix multiplication is performed in a single shot, with a time complexity of O(1) and an energy cost proportional to the number of nonzero elements in the matrices

  - In the forward pass, compute the optical matrix products A[l+1] = f(W[l] A[l]), where A[l] is the activation matrix of layer l and f is the activation function
  - In the backward pass, compute the optical matrix products δ[l] = W[l+1]^T δ[l+1] * f'(A[l]), where * denotes element-wise multiplication and f' is the derivative of the activation function
  - Use optoelectronic interfaces to convert the optical activations A[l] and gradients δ[l] to electronic signals, and vice versa
  - Use electronic circuits to compute the element-wise products and apply the activation function derivatives
  - Use optical feedback connections to route the gradients δ[l] back to the corresponding weight matrices W[l] for update
  - The optical backpropagation achieves a similar time and energy complexity as the forward pass, with an additional constant factor for the electronic overhead
  - By leveraging the speed and efficiency of optical matrix multiplication, optical backpropagation can significantly accelerate the training of large-scale neural networks compared to electronic implementations
  - Therefore, optical backpropagation is a promising approach for realizing scalable and efficient optical learning in low-cost optical neurocomputing systems
